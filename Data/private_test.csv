910,Miroslava Breach murder: Mexico jails man who ordered journalist's death,"image copyrightEPA

A man in Mexico has been given a 50-year prison sentence for ordering the killing of a prominent journalist.

Miroslava Breach, who covered drugs violence and corruption in the country, was one of 11 journalists murdered in 2017 in Mexico.

Prosecutors said the lengthy prison term for Juan Carlos Moreno set a precedent in cases involving crimes against free expression.

Some 90% of attacks on journalists in the country reportedly go unsolved.

A press rights group, Propuesta Cívica, urged the Mexican authorities to investigate such attacks.

Four journalists have been killed this year, according to journalism watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which describes Mexico as ""one of world's deadliest countries for the media"".

""Collusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists' safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels,"" it says.

Why was Miroslava Breach targeted?

The 54-year-old was shot eight times in her car outside her home in the city of Chihuahua on 23 March 2017. One of her children was in the vehicle but was not hurt.

Breach had reported on organised crime, drug-trafficking and corruption for a national newspaper, La Jornada, and a regional newspaper, Norte de Ciudad Juárez.

Her killers left a note saying: ""For being a loud-mouth.""

Prosecutors say she was murdered ""with premeditation"" after being sent intimidating messages meant to impinge on her freedom of expression, AFP news agency reports.

Moreno was convicted of being the ""intellectual author"" of Breach's murder.

According to the El Paso Times, Moreno was allegedly the ""jefe de pistoleros"" (leader of gunmen) - for Los Salazar, a faction of the Sinaloa drug cartel.

The man suspected of the actual shooting, Ramon Zavala, was himself killed by unidentified assailants.

How will the journalist be remembered?

In 2018, the UN and AFP launched an award to honour journalists who risked their lives covering human rights abuses in Mexico.

The prize was created in tribute to Breach and another murdered journalist, Javier Valdez.

Javier Valdez, known for his award-winning coverage of the drug trade, was shot dead by unidentified attackers in Culiacán in the north-western state of Sinaloa, where he lived and worked, on 15 May 2017.",1

709,Ex-Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson And Seven Other Cases Of Resume Fraud,"From the Fiscal Times:

The latest victim to fall from grace due to resume fraud is Scott Thompson, who was named Yahoo’s chief executive in January. The former president of PayPal graduated from Stonehill College in Massachusetts with a degree in accounting – but he also claimed he had a degree in computer science. Turns out the college didn’t offer that degree until several years after Thompson claimed he earned his.
“Holding these credentials seem(ed) very plausible for someone with Thompson’s job history,” Melinda Blackman, a professor of psychology at California State University in Fullerton, said on CNN this morning, “and since he was a well known and successful executive, a background check was probably put on the backburner.”

After being exposed by a Yahoo shareholder, Daniel S. Loeb, however, Thompson apologized for the misrepresentation and has now stepped down. (He’s also reportedly told the board that he’s been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.) What’s clear is that he’s not the only high-profile business or government leader to have been caught fudging the details of personal credentials. Plenty of folks before him have gotten away with it.

478,2 Chinese nationals charged in $100M cryptocurrency scheme,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two Chinese nationals were charged Monday with laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency that had been stolen by North Korean hackers, U.S. prosecutors said.

Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were charged in an indictment unsealed in Washington with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Prosecutors allege the North Korean hackers gained access to a virtual currency exchange in 2018 and stole nearly $250 million worth of virtual currency before laundering the cryptocurrency through several transactions. The hackers used doctored photographs and fake identification to avoid scrutiny and used the stolen money to pay for tools used in other North Korean hacking campaigns, the Justice Department said.

Authorities charge that between December 2017 and April 2019, Yinyin and Jiadong were responsible for laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency. They also allege the two did business in the U.S. and failed to register with the Treasury Department, as required by law.

The U.S. also alleges that North Korean co-conspirators are “tied to the theft of approximately $48.5 million worth of virtual currency from a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange in November 2019.” Prosecutors said those hackers laundered the stolen money through hundreds of automated transactions.

“The hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money laundering for the benefit of North Korean actors poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global financial system,” said Timothy Shea, the U.S. attorney in the nation’s capital.

In addition to the indictment, prosecutors also filed a civil forfeiture complaint to recover the stolen funds, which names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses that they say were used by Yinyin and Jiadong and their alleged co-conspirators. Authorities say a portion of the stolen money has already been recovered.",1
863,"Former minister falls on hard times, dragged to court over debt","Originally by Daily News

Former minister in the then vice president Joice Mujuru’s office, Flora Buka has been dragged to the High Court after failing to pay $87 000 owed to Paperhole Investments (Private) Limited.

According to court papers, Buka signed an acknowledgement of debt, which has become the basis for the court application.

“Plaintiff’s claim against the defendant (Buka) is based on a liquid document in the form of an acknowledgement of debt duly executed by and between the defendant and plaintiff on the 14th of September 2016.

“In terms of the acknowledgment of debt, the defendant acknowledged its indebtedness to the plaintiff in the sum of $87 267,01, which amount was to be repaid in full on or before the 31st of December 2016,” the court heard.

The origins of the debt were not stated in the court papers, except a copy of the acknowledgement of debt and reference to the same document.

According to the acknowledgement of debt document, in the event of a default in payment, interest would continue to be levied at the computed rate of one percent per month, calculated from September 14, 2016.

“The defendant has failed to tender payment as agreed or at all, towards liquidating the sums owed and is therefore in breach of the acknowledgment of debt.

“Despite demand, the defendant has failed, refused and/or neglected to pay the amount claimed despite being liable to do so,” the court was told.

The matter, which has been brought for a provisional sentence will be heard today before High Court judge Jester Charewa.

In terms of the acknowledgment of debt document, there was not going to be any variation of the agreement unless reduced to writing and signed by the debtor and creditor.

“In the event of the debtor failing to pay any amount as and when it becomes due hereunder, then the creditor shall have the right without notice to claim and recover the whole of the capital sum and interest, or the balance thereof the outstanding, together with costs and collection charges and to institute legal proceedings against the debtor.

“The debtor shall be liable for the legal costs of such action on the scale of attorney and client,” part of the acknowledgment of debt reads.

Buka has no yet respondent to the application.",1
741,Trumpworld’s Corruption Is as Globalized as the Ultra-Rich the President Mingles With,"Elliott Broidy, the vice chairman for the 2016 Trump campaign’s joint fundraising committee with the Republican Party that raised over $108 million, is expected to plead guilty to violating foreign lobbying law, joining other prominent members of President Donald Trump’s inner circle, including, most infamously, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Rick Gates. Broidy’s indictment emerged from a multibillion-dollar case of global fraud that has garnered remarkably little public attention—but that is deeply revealing about the nature of international corruption in the Trump era.

Broidy’s fall was an unexpected consequence of the unraveling of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a Malaysian state fund ostensibly set up to promote development through foreign investment but whose masterminds used it to leverage loans of $4.5 billion on the global financial markets, which they then siphoned off. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, its chairman, has been arrested, as have his close associates. Goldman Sachs, which brokered these loans and whose involvement then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions dubbed “kleptocracy at its worst,” has reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the Malaysian government, though it remains under the shadow of U.S. legal penalties. Broidy’s own relatively modest role in the scandal was a result of his alleged lobbying to influence the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into 1MDB on behalf of Jho Low, the accused mastermind of the fraud. This included an unsuccessful attempt to arrange a golf game between Trump and Najib in 2017. (Malaysia didn’t just target Republicans. In 2014, Najib came under fire for engaging in what he called “golf diplomacy” with President Barack Obama while his country reeled from some of its worst flooding in years.)

In a week of political whiplash, with its own astonishing revelations about Trump’s taxes and his collapsing health, this story is unlikely to garner notice. But ignoring Broidy’s connections to international corruption and to Trump’s world would be repeating old mistakes.

In 2016, when 11.5 million documents from the world’s fourth largest offshore provider, Mossack Fonseca, were leaked, the web of global corruption implicated at least 140 politicians from more than 50 countries, as well as celebrities like Simon Cowell, Jackie Chan, Lionel Messi, and Amitabh Bachchan. The list was impressively inclusive, with the rich of every color, creed, and nation well represented in the tranche of documents that came to be known as the Panama Papers. Yet the ensuing fallout focused on the offshore nature of these tax havens, and politicians vowed to protect domestic interests by preventing the fugitive escape of capital from national coffers. Meanwhile, a wave of nationalist politicians tapped into an inchoate anger at a globalized world, whose promised riches had turned out to be fool’s gold for too many. A retrenchment at home, through nationalism, was cast as a ritual purification of the excesses and corruptions of globalization. Trump promised to “drain the swamp” and India’s Narendra Modi to bring home the black money stashed away abroad. The weaponization of anti-corruption by nationalist leaders was more than mere rhetoric: Jair Bolsonaro arguably came to power in Brazil through the targeted prosecution of rival left-wing politicians as part of Operation Car Wash.

Four years later, nationalist politicians have overseen the unbridled growth of corruption under their watch. Far from repatriating black money, India is currently fighting a desultory battle to extradite two businessmen—Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi—who alone have defrauded Indian banks of nearly $3 billion under Prime Minister Modi’s watch. (More telling, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has grown to become the richest by far among Indian political parties, mostly funded through unidentifiable donors.) Bolsonaro has triumphantly announced the end of Operation Car Wash, “because the government has no more corruption,” despite pending criminal investigations of his immediate family and close associates for graft. The breathtakingly brazen move follows revelations of Operation Car Wash’s politically motivated prosecutions, allowing Bolsonaro to lay the groundwork to scapegoat his former ally and justice minister, Sérgio Moro, after he resisted Bolsonaro’s blatant attempts to undermine the legal system to protect his inner circle. And the revolving door between the Trump political world and prison has now become a banality.

It’s in this light that Trump’s own financial situation, as revealed through his taxes, must be read. Trump’s wealth comes not through successful entrepreneurship but by exploiting the tax and credit systems—and through access to the interconnected world of the global elite. The New York Times deemed the tax code’s provision allowing business owners to carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years “the background music to Mr. Trump’s life.” Even the few tripwires for the rich in the tax code can clearly be easily sidestepped.

Ultimately, what allowed the longevity of this shell game was endless access to global finance, facilitated by class connections rather than competence. The Trump family lives, lavishly and with all the accoutrements of celebrity, on credit. Trump’s personal debts, most of which are due in the next few years, totals at least $421 million. Despite a proven track record of mismanaging businesses, which brought him to the brink of bankruptcy before The Apprentice threw him a lifeline (ironically, by playing a successful businessman), banks have lined up to loan him nearly half a billion dollars. He secured these loans in a way that’s familiar from the international circuit of corrupt businessmen, from Mallya to Low—not through proven competence but through massaging personal connections and cultivating the mystique of celebrity.

In an article on Low published before the 1MDB scandal exploded, the Times presented a two-faced portrait of a cosmopolitan jetsetter, indiscriminately buying Jean-Michel Basquiat’s paintings and penthouses, hobnobbing with Paris Hilton and rap stars, and a shady, faintly disreputable broker who leveraged boarding school and university contacts with scions of various ruling families into a global business. Low himself explained his modus operandi as an investor as not merely about “managing their money well” but rather providing a kind of “concierge service” for the rich and powerful to facilitate their access to the lifestyle they feel entitled to. Tabloid photographs of Mallya with Bollywood stars not only cemented his reputation as the “King of Good Times”—it helped him acquire a nomination to the upper house of the Indian Parliament and eventually to secure the nearly $1 billion loan with which he absconded. The Mallyas and Lows and Trumps of the world offer as collateral little more than their celebrity to secure unlimited access to global lines of credit.

The strong-arm leaders Trump assiduously cultivates, from India’s Modi to the Philippines’s Rodrigo Duterte and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, all head countries that house his most lucrative overseas businesses—and they know it. Not only do these countries extract more in tax revenue from Trump than the United States itself, but their leaders have cannily used his business entanglements to diplomatic advantage. Duterte chose the businessman behind the Trump Tower in Manila as his envoy, while Erdogan’s delegations and Turkish state businesses patronize Trump establishments in the United States selectively as a reward for U.S. diplomatic compromise with Turkey.

Among those nursing a hangover from the Cold War, these entanglements provoke predictable anxiety. One genre of responses to the report on his taxes was to revive the idea of Trump as Russia’s Manchurian candidate. (Or is it China’s Rasputin?) This perspective frames the Trump presidency as a matryoshka of power, in which some foreign adversary uses Trump as a useful idiot as he himself helms his own army of useful idiots, convinced he will make America great again despite all contrary evidence. Yet this blinkered national security view misses the point.

The meticulous and prosaic reconstruction of Trump’s finances from his tax returns allowed the public to peek behind the wizard’s curtain of lies and manipulation. In that moment of clarity, what we saw was a global elite, undifferentiated by ideology or creed or nation, that mingles in country clubs and bottle-service VIP rooms, whose children attend the same boarding schools and Ivy League universities and eventually marry each other, for whom social capital is capital.

The seemingly incongruous image of Dennis Rodman sitting beside a cherubic and murderous Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang becomes far more comprehensible if seen next to images of Low carting Busta Rhymes around George Town, Malaysia, or Kanye West standing beside President-elect Trump in Trump Tower in New York. Trump’s career is ultimately a product of this interconnected and profoundly corrupt world, in which celebrity, wealth, and power are interchangeable currency and which makes a mockery of the rule of law and of democracy.",1
457,Ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin charged with murder in George Floyd case,"The former Minneapolis police officer shown on video putting his knee on George Floyd's neck for more than 8 1/2 minutes — as he pleaded for air and his mother — was arrested Friday and charged with murder, authorities said.

Derek Chauvin, who was fired on Tuesday along with the three other officers involved in the arrest of Floyd, was taken into custody Friday and faces charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced.

Passers-by took video of Floyd pleading ""I can't breathe,"" as Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on Floyd's neck for exactly 8 minutes and 45 seconds on Monday night, according to state charging documents, citing footage from officers' body cameras.

That deadly time span allegedly included 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd passed out. Chauvin should have known ""that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,"" according to the complaint.

""Derek Michael Chauvin caused the death of George Floyd by his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and taking a chance of causing death or great bodily harm to George Floyd,"" the complaint said.

Floyd had been handcuffed for allegedly passing a phony $20 bill at the corner store. He refused to get into a squad car and was ""intentionally falling down,"" saying he was claustrophobic and struggling to breathe, according to the complaint.

""While standing outside the car, Mr. Floyd began saying and repeating that he could not breathe,"" the document said.

When the cuffed Floyd was eventually put facedown on the pavement, the ""defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck,"" according to prosecutors.

""Mr. Floyd said, 'I can’t breathe' multiple times and repeatedly said, 'Mama' and 'please,' as well.""

One of Chauvin's colleagues suggested rolling Floyd on to his side but Chauvin allegedly said,"" No, staying put where we got him.”

When Floyd stopped moving, Officer J. Alexander Kueng ""checked Mr. Floyd’s right wrist for a pulse and said, 'I couldn’t find one.' None of the officers moved from their positions,"" the complaint said.

The medical examiner found no evidence that Floyd died from traumatic asphyxia or strangulation, the complaint said.

Instead, Floyd had coronary artery and hypertensive heart disease and, “the combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,"" according to the complaint.

Freeman said he anticipated more charges to come, possibly against some of the other three officers.

“The investigation is ongoing,"" Freeman said, ""We felt it was appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator. This case has moved with extraordinary speed.”

Just 24 hours earlier, Freeman had said the case still needed more investigation.

But by Friday, Freeman said enough evidence had been gathered.

""All of that has come together and we felt, in our professional judgement, it was time to charge,"" Freeman told reporters.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the FBI are both investigating Floyd’s death. The state bureau arrested Chauvin at 11:44 a.m. in Minneapolis, the state agency said.

A conviction for third-degree murder could land an offender in prison for up to 25 years.

Third-degree murder means an offender did not intend to kill, but that someone died “by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.”

Floyd's family, represented by civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, welcomed the arrest but said the officer should be facing a first-degree murder charge.

Under Minnesota statutes, first-degree murder is defined as a slaying that includes ""premeditation and with intent to effect the death of the person or of another."" Second-degree murder is often applied to drive-by shootings or other killings while the offender is ""intentionally inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily harm upon the victim.""

""The arrest of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the brutal killing of George Floyd is a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice. We expected a first-degree murder charge,"" according to a family statement from Crump's office.

""And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer.""

The man who killed George Floyd has been charged with murder. This an essential first step on a much longer road toward justice and healing our city.

— Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 29, 2020

Freeman noted that these charges mirrored the same criminal complaint filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, in another high-profile local case involving excessive force.

Noor was convicted of third-degree murder for the July 15, 2017, slaying of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual citizen of the United States and Australia.

Freeman said the prosecution of police officers, who act while on duty, are particularly difficult cases.

“This is by far the fastest we’ve ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said. ""Normally these cases can take nine months to a year.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey welcomed the former police officer's arrest.

""The man who killed George Floyd has been charged with murder,"" Frey sad in a statement. ""This an essential first step on a much longer road toward justice and healing our city.""

Protests rock the Twin Cities amid calls for Chauvin to be charged

Chauvin's arrest comes after three days of protests in the Twin Cities, with the unrest in some areas erupting into violence.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had called this week for charges to be filed swiftly against the officer who pinned Floyd under his knee. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?"" Frey asked. ""If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now.”

In the video, Floyd can be heard saying while he is pinned down, ""Please, please, please, I can't breathe.""

Onlookers urged the officer to get off him.

""You're stopping his breathing right now, you think that's cool?"" a man says. ""His nose is bleeding. Look at his nose!"" says a woman.

After several minutes, Floyd went silent.

More people began to intervene and called one of the officers at the scene to check for a pulse. Chauvin remained on Floyd's neck, even as he was apparently unresponsive, before paramedics arrived and Floyd is placed on a stretcher.

Medics worked on an unresponsive Floyd in an ambulance, but could not find a pulse after several checks and administering at least one shock to him, according to a report from the Minneapolis Fire Department.

Security footage obtained by NBC from a nearby restaurant showed some of the events leading up to Floyd's arrest. The video captures two officers arriving at the scene around 8 p.m., removing Floyd from a car parked on the street, handcuffing and questioning him before eventually walking him across the street as another police car arrives.

Piecing together the moments before Floyd’s death

May 29, 202003:09

Chauvin had been the subject of prior complaints

Chauvin, a 19-year department veteran, was the subject of over a dozen prior police conduct complaints unrelated to Floyd that resulted in no disciplinary action and one that led to a ""letter of reprimand"" during his career. A longtime police training expert for the state of Minnesota told NBC News that a dozen complaints over a two-decade career would appear ""a little bit higher than normal.”

The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement the day of the officers’ termination that it was not the time to rush to judgment and that the officers were fully cooperating with the investigation.

""We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report,"" the statement said. ""Officers' actions and training protocol will be carefully examined after the officers have provided their statements.""

Attempts to reach the officers and their attorneys have been unsuccessful.

930,Mexico: Ex-President Enrique Peña Nieto accused of corruption and bribery,"image copyrightAFP

Prosecutors in Mexico have opened a corruption investigation against former President Enrique Peña Nieto.

It comes after Emilio Lozoya, the ex-head of the state energy firm, accused Mr Peña Nieto of taking millions of dollars in bribes and bribing MPs.

Mr Lozoya was extradited from Spain last month to stand trial on corruption charges linked to Brazil's construction giant Odebrecht.

Mr Peña Nieto, who was in office in 2012-18, has so far made no comments.

El Chapo 'paid $100m bribe to former Mexican president Peña Nieto'
Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal explained

Last year, a witness testifying at a US trial of Mexico's drug cartel kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán said Mr Peña Nieto had accepted a $100m (£77m) bribe from the mobster.

The ex-president also made no comments on that allegation, but he has previously rejected allegations of corruption.

What did Emilio Lozoya say?

Mr Lozoya was a former top official during Mr Peña Nieto's 2012 campaign, and head of the state-owned oil giant Pemex from 2012 to 2016.

Mr Lozoya said Mr Peña Nieto and former Finance Minister Luis Videgaray had ordered him to funnel more than $4m in bribes from Odebrecht into the 2012 presidential election campaign.

In a second allegation, Mr Lozoya said that once in power Mr Peña Nieto and Mr Videgaray used a similar amount to bribe lawmakers to ensure the passage of a crucial energy reform bill through parliament.

Mr Lozoya said he could bring in four witnesses, as well as video and other documents to back up his accusations.

Mr Lozoya was one of the most powerful figures in Mexico when he was the president's adviser.

Neither Mr Peña Nieto nor Mr Videgaray have commented on the specific allegations against them. They have not been charged with anything.

However, Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz considered the testimony important enough to have launched an investigation into the matter.

In the past, no former president in Mexico has gone to jail despite successive governments being tainted by widespread corruption, the BBC's Mexico correspondent Will Grant says.

Incumbent President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had earlier said he was not in favour of bringing charges against his predecessor - but would defer to any decision reached by the attorney general.",1
912,"'This is not a game, nephew': Pile of bodies discovered outside Nuevo Laredo residence","Mexican authorities said they discovered a pile of bodies dumped outside a residence Thursday near a sports complex in east Nuevo Laredo.

Another body was found mutilated inside the home, according to reports.

Tamaulipas Department of Public Safety spokesman Luis Alberto Rodriguez told Mexican media outlets that authorities have opened an investigation into the nine bodies found.

Authorities said they were discovered on the sidewalk near the intersection of Abraham Lincoln and Porfirio Diaz streets.

A banner lying over the bodies reads, “This is not a game, nephew,” according to a photo posted on social media.

“I just passed by that street and the people who live there were washing those sidewalks, the hideous blood odor,” a Facebook user commented under a picture showing the bodies.

Earlier, some Nuevo Laredoans took to Facebook asking what was happening in the area. An investigation is underway.

This comes a week after the sentencing of Ivàn “El Taliban” Velázquez Caballero, who served as a plaza boss for Nuevo Laredo in 2004 under the Gulf Cartel before moving up the ranks and becoming one of the leaders of the Zetas from 2005 until his arrest by Mexican authorities in 2012.

Velásquez received a 30-year prison sentence last Friday in a local federal court for drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges he pleaded guilty to in 2014.

Macabre

The macabre discovery also came a day after a threatening message circulated on social media. An old faction of the Zetas drug trafficking organization, known as La Vieja Guardia, threatened the Cartel del Noreste, or younger generation Zetas.

The message, which continues circulating on social media, states, “People of Nuevo Laredo, tell your children to stop frequenting the night clubs. All of the sudden, we will throw out grenades and burn down the clubs and everything that finances the Norestitas (CDN members).”

The message also threatens forwarding agencies in the Sister City. It’s unclear if the threats are related to the bodies discovered Thursday. Z-47 and Z-33 signed the warning.

Z-33

Court records filed in the Southern District of Texas identified Z-33 as Eduardo Mendoza-Robles, 50.

A 21-page indictment filed in a local federal court in 2012 lists Mendoza-Robles as one of eight defendants charged with various kidnapping, hostage-taking and firearms charges.

Mendoza-Robles faces a sole count of conspiracy to export arms.

The gun smuggling charges against Mendoza-Robles, who remains a fugitive in Mexico, stem from November 2010, when local law enforcement seized 40 weapons that were allegedly going to be smuggled to the Zetas.

The San Antonio Express-News reported that it’s a case with ties to weapons traffickers who provided the Zetas drug cartel with a gun used in the killing of Jaime Zapata, the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement special agent who was ambushed and killed by the gang in February 2011 in San Luis Potosi, Mexico.

In early 2014, the Treasury Department announced Kingpin Act sanctions against Mendoza-Robles for the arms smuggling case.

Mendoza-Robles is a member of the gang who smuggled “drugs, weapons and cash across the U.S.-Mexico border on behalf” of the cartel, according to the Treasury Department.",1

567,Anti-virus creator John McAfee arrested over tax evasion charges,"Anti-virus software entrepreneur John McAfee has been arrested in Spain and faces extradition to the US where he has been charged with tax evasion.

Prosecutors say he failed to file tax returns for four years, despite earning millions from consulting work, speaking engagements, crypto-currencies and selling the rights to his life story.

None of the income is connected with the software firm which bears his name.

Mr McAfee has not publicly commented on the charges.

If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison.

In a statement the US Justice Department said Mr McAfee allegedly evaded tax liability by having his income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees. As a result, it is alleged, he failed to file any tax returns from 2014 to 2018.

He is also accused of concealing assets, including a yacht and real estate property, in the names of others.

The strange life of John McAfee

The charges were announced shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had brought civil charges against Mr McAfee.

The government regulator alleges that Mr McAfee made over $23m (£17.7m) by ""leveraging his fame"" and recommending seven cryptocurrency offerings between 2017 and 2018, which allegedly turned out to be ""essentially worthless"", without disclosing that he was paid to do so.

The SEC is seeking to impose a civil penalty on him, and disgorge him of any ""allegedly ill-gotten gains"", with interest. It also wants to permanently ban him from serving as an officer or director of any listed company, or any company which files reports to the SEC.

In addition, the SEC has charged Mr McAfee's bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, with aiding and abetting the sale of digital currencies, along with other allegations.

Neither he nor Mr McAfee have commented publicly on the charges.

Mr McAfee is a controversial figure in the technology sector. He came to prominence in the 1980s when he founded a company that released the first commercial anti-virus software - McAfee VirusScan - and helped spark a multi-billion dollar industry.

Although that business has since been sold to Intel, he still develops cyber-security products of his own.

The entrepreneur, who was born in the UK, also launched unsuccessful bids to become the Libertarian Party's candidate for the presidential elections in 2016 and 2020.

Mr McAfee has previously expressed his disdain for taxes, tweeting last year that he hadn't filed tax returns for eight years because ""taxation is illegal.""

Last year he was also briefly detained in the Dominican Republic for allegedly bringing weapons into the country.

In 2012, Mr McAfee made headlines after Belize police began investigating the death of his neighbour, Florida businessman Gregory Faull, and named Mr McAfee as a ""person of interest"".

Mr McAfee left the country after the death, saying he feared for his own safety, but said he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with the killing.",1
846,The Comeback of Suriname’s ‘Narco-President’,"SHARE

The president of the tiny Caribbean nation Suriname has been charged with murder, convicted of drug trafficking, and accused of leading an international drug cartel. So why is he in power?

A recent New York Times report looks at the checkered history of President Desi Bouterse, who regained power in August 2010. He previously ruled for seven years as head of a repressive police state, after taking power in a coup in 1980.

As well as murdering opponents, Bouterse is accused of masterminding the growth of drug trafficking through Suriname in the 1990s.

According to reports, he worked with Brazilian traffickers who would pick up weapons in Suriname and smuggle them into Colombia. In a deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC), the Brazilians would swap weapons for cocaine, some of which was then trafficked onwards to Europe from Suriname.

One report says that a witness claimed the weapons were stolen from the Surinamian army. Others say arms were smuggled from Florida by the Russian mafia.

Bouterse’s alleged role in this, as a still-influential figure in Suriname’s politics even after his first period in power ended, was to allow the Brazilians to land in the country. In exchange he received a share of the cocaine to sell on.

Together the Brazilians and Bouterse were known as the “Suri Cartel.” Many of the key players in this operation were arrested, including its founder, Brazilian Leonardo Dias Mendonca, who was captured in a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation in 1999.

However, the Caribbean country has remained a key transshipment country for drugs destined for Europe, says the U.S. State Department’s 2011 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. The report notes that in 2010 the Caribbean country seized more than 340 kilos of cocaine, and almost 33 liters of liquid cocaine.

Suriname may also still be of strategic important for the FARC. Documents seized from computer disks in a FARC camp in 2010 detailed operations to send and receive goods to and from Suriname.

Bouterse may have been involved in the drug trade as recently as 2006, according to unreleased U.S. diplomatic cables seen by the Dutch media.

Peculiarities of country’s legal system played a role in Bouterse’s comeback — a Dutch court found in 1999 that Bouterse had masterminded the shipment of two tons of cocaine to Europe, but the former leader avoided his 11 year jail term because Suriname has a law against extraditing citizens. The presidential immunity he gained last year puts him in an even safer position.

Another factor was the absence of credible political alternatives. Ronnie Brunswijk, his main rival and now coalition partner, has also been convicted of cocaine trafficking by a Dutch court.

But the real question here is how a convicted narcotics smuggler could win a nation’s presidency. Not untypical for the Caribbean, the answer seems to be money — in a poor state with a weak democracy, his fortune has made Bouterse one of the richest men in the country. His power and influence, as well as the name recognition that is crucial in South America’s dynasty-dominated elections, allowed him to form a coalition and gain enough votes in parliament to claw his way back to power.",1
211,Ex-Tyco CEO Kozlowski found guilty,"NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - In a major victory in the government crackdown on corporate corruption, former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski and ex-CFO Mark Swartz were found guilty Friday of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the manufacturing conglomerate.

A jury of six men and six women deliberated 11 days before finding Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of 23 counts of grand larceny and conspiracy, falsifying business records and violating general business law. They face 15 to 30 years in prison.

Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, were accused of taking bonuses worth more than $120 million without the approval of Tyco's directors, abusing an employee loan program, and misrepresenting the company's financial condition to investors to boost the stock price while selling $575 million in stock.

After the verdicts were read in court Friday afternoon, Dennis Kozlowski's face was scarlet red and his daughter buried her face in her hands, according to an eyewitness. Swartz' wife appeared to be in shock and Kozlowski's wife was crying.

The Tyco verdict comes as jury deliberations continue in Alabama, where former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy is accused of directing a $2.7 billion accounting fraud. Ex-WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers was found guilty in March over his role in an $11 billion accounting scandal at the telecommunications giant now known as MCI.

Other high-profile trials loom. Former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay and his key deputies have a 2006 court date for their role in the Houston energy giant's late 2001 collapse.

Friday's win was crucial for Tyco prosecutors, whose first trial against Kozlowski and Swartz ended in a mistrial in April 2004 after the sole juror holding out for an acquittal reported receiving threats. In July 2004 former Tyco general counsel Mark Belnick was acquitted of securities fraud and grand larceny in a separate, but related trial.

Not a huge surprise

The reaction among legal experts was mixed Friday, but many said the verdict was expected given that 11 out of 12 jurors voted to convict in the first trial.

The defense had a difficult case, said former federal prosecutor Jerry Bernstein. Both Kozlowski and Swartz maintained that Tyco's board of directors and its auditors were aware of and authorized the bonuses they received as part of their compensation packages. The duo ran the company for most of the 1990's through 2002.

But they were unable to prove it, said Bernstein. Five former Tyco directors testified they never knew of the disputed payments.

""It's always a difficult defense when a corporate executive gets a lot of money and there isn't a sufficiently clear paper trail showing the executive was entitled to that money,"" said Bernstein, a partner in Blank Rome, a New York-based law firm.

Both the defense and the prosecution changed their strategies in the second trial, which began in January. Prosecutors left out sordid details about Kozlowski's lavish spending during his tenure as Tyco's top executive, including a $2 million birthday party he threw for his wife on the Italian island of Sardinia and a $6,000 shower curtain allegedly purchased with company funds (see correction).

""While it's hard to compare-and-contrast (the two trials), there's no question that prosecutors tried a more streamlined case this time,"" said Jacob Frenkel, a former prosecutor now in private practice in Maryland.

Kozlowski, meanwhile, testified in his own defense during the second trial after declining to take the stand before. Swartz testified at both trials.

Legal experts said it was hard to say if Kozlowski's decision to testify backfired until jurors are interviewed in coming days. His testimony clearly did not help his case.

After the verdict, the government requested mandatory jail time of 15 to 30 years in state prison.

New York State Supreme Court Judge Michael Obus set an Aug. 2 sentencing date and allowed both men to remain free until their sentencing. Kozlowski and Swartz will appeal their convictions.

A different kind of corruption case

The Tyco case differs in a few key respects from other recent high-profile trials involving once-powerful corporate executives.

While all of the cases contain elements of self-dealing, Kozlowski and Swartz were not charged with accounting fraud -- unlike WorldCom's Ebbers, Scrushy's HealthSouth, and Enron's Lay.

The trial of Kozlowski and Swartz was solely about the improper use of company funds -- in other words, greed.

Kozlowski and Swartz face time in state prison, which tends to be grittier, with more violent inmates, than the federal system.

124,Terror charges filed against 17 in Spain,"A Spanish judge has filed terror charges against 17 people for their alleged role in a suspected plot to blow up the National Court, a hub for the nation's investigations into Islamic terrorism.

Judge Baltasar Garzon filed the charges late yesterday after questioning the 18 suspects. Eight of the suspects were arrested this week in connection with the alleged plot while 10 were already in jail for separate cases.

One of those arrested during the week, Smail Latrech of Algeria, was kept in custody pending further investigations.

Sixteen of the suspects, mostly Moroccans and Algerians, were charged with belonging to an armed group. The 17th, a Spaniard identified as Baldomero Lara, was charged with collaboration. No one was allowed bail.

The charges are temporary, pending further investigations, and do not constitute a formal indictment.

Garzon said the suspects formed part of a cell named the ""Martyrs for Morocco"" that was set up by a man called Mohamed Achraf, 31, during his time in jail in Spain in 1999-2002 for credit card fraud.

Achraf was detained in Switzerland this week following a warrant by Garzon.

The cell's main plan was to detonate a truck packed with explosives at the court, Garzon said.

""Achraf had made the necessary preparations to acquire 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of explosives, of which at least 500 kilograms were to be packed into a truck that would be crashed into the National Court,"" Garzon said in his court order.

Achraf is believed to be Algerian and to have had ties to the Armed Islamic Group, which launched a violent campaign in 1992 to topple the Algerian government and set up an Islamic state.

Spain has asked for his extradition.

Garzon said Achraf ordered the attack to be carried out urgently and that the cost did not matter.

The group, he said, aimed ""to end the lives of those inside (judges, officials and the public in general) and destroy archives which concern 'mujahedeen brothers.""

He said one of the 10 already in jail, a Mauritanian named Kamara Birahima Diadie, was to make contact with a gypsy identified only as Antonio, who was to obtain the explosives. A Palestinian, identified only as Salim, was to prepare the mechanism to explode the bomb, the judge added.

Four persons, including Achraf, were to carry out the court attack, the magistrate said.

Garzon, an anti-terrorism specialist, works out of the court, which is located in downtown Madrid.

Achraf's name surfaced after police, acting on testimony from a protected witness in contact with Achraf this summer in Spain, arrested the eight purported cell members.

Garzon said three of those already in jail for membership in the Armed Islamic Group — Abdelkrim Bensmail, Mohamed Amine Akli y Bachir Belhakem — were also close friends of Allekema Lamari, one of seven militants believed to have been behind the March 11 train bombings in Madrid. The seven blew themselves up weeks later as police moved in to arrest them.

Achraf was arrested Aug. 28 for entering Switzerland without identifying documents. He was held in a detention center for illegal immigrants in Zurich and was awaiting deportation when officials learned he was allegedly linked to the Spanish plot.

Spanish police are believed to have intercepted calls made by Achraf and found mailed instructions from him.

In the court order, Garzon also issued arrest warrants for seven others.

Garzon has indicted 41 people over the past year on terrorism charges, including Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida suspects accused of staging the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.

Another judge, Juan del Olmo, is leading the probe into the March 11 bombings.",1
334,Brazil bans third builder from government work for Petrobras bribes,"BRASILIA, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Brazil on Monday banned IESA Oil & Gas from government work for paying bribes, the third construction and engineering company barred in the massive graft and political kickbacks scandal involving contracts with state oil company Petrobras.

The Ministry of Transparency, Brazil’s primary anti-corruption agency, said IESA would not be able to bid for new government contracts for at least two years, and lifting the ban will depend on repayment of losses to Petrobras.

Brazilian builder Mendes Junior Engenharia was barred from bidding for government contracts in April and the local unit of Swedish construction company Skanska AB was banned in May.

All of the banned companies have denied wrongdoing. Skanska, the world’s No. 5 construction firm, has challenged the Brazil government decision to ban its subsidiary from new contracts.

The ministry said in a statement that IESA took part in a cartel that fixed prices on contracts with Petróleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-led oil company is formally called.

It said IESA used a fictitious consultancy contract to pay bribes to Paulo Roberto Costa, the former Petrobras director of refining and supply who was arrested in March 2014 at the start of the corruption investigation dubbed “Operation Car Wash” by Brazilian police. Costa admitted involvement in the graft scheme.

Dozens of construction company executives have been arrested in the probe and some 50 politicians are under investigation in a scandal that has shaken Brazil’s political establishment to the core and contributed to the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff who was removed from office last week.

IESA representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Of the 29 companies investigated for involvement in the bribery scheme, three have been banned and nine are negotiating leniency deals that require recognition of guilt and repayment of damages, a ministry spokesman said. Accusations against three others have been dropped.

The ministry had been called the Comptroller General’s office, but was renamed by the new government of President Michel Temer, who has vowed to crack down on corruption in Brazil. His government, however, has been hit by corruption allegations that have forced three cabinet minister to resign. (Reporting by Anthony Boadle, editing by G Crosse)",1
189,Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe accused of breaching constitution to promote his 'corrupt' wife Grace,"A concerted drive by parliament and the people, with the backing of the military, is due to take place on Tuesday to try and force Robert Mugabe to resign. MPs will start impeachment proceedings against the President while hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to march on his mansion vowing to put it under siege until he leaves.

But there were also reports that Mr Mugabe has called for a cabinet meeting on Tuesday as well to show that he is still in charge. A notice from his chief secretary has instructed all members to attend at 9am. The President is nonetheless still under house arrest and many of his ministers have been detained following last week’s military coup. The place where cabinet meetings are held, Munhumutapa Building in the centre of the capital, is now shut and guarded by soldiers and an armoured personnel carrier.

The moves come after an extraordinary and chaotic 24 hours in which Mr Mugabe apparently agreed to resign on state television but instead used the broadcast, sitting next to military commanders who are his captors, to vow that he will stay on in office to unify the nation and supervise reforms.

Mr Mugabe then ignored an ultimatum from his own party, Zanu-PF, which had stripped him of leadership, to resign by midday Monday or face impeachment. There are differing accounts of how long it will take to remove the President from office through the process, ranging from one day to more than a week.

Separately, the organisation of veterans who fought in the war against white minority rule has announced that it will take legal action at the High Court to force Mr Mugabe’s resignation. Its head, Christopher Mutsvangwa, charged that the President had condemned himself out of his own mouth when making his speech on which he admitted failures by his government.

“He admitted to dereliction of duty during that non-event announcement of his on national television. As a result, we are going to file court papers seeking his removal,” said Mr Mutsvangwa.

Various reasons have been offered as to why Mr Mugabe didn’t resign during the speech on Sunday evening, ranging from claims that he swapped the agreed script for another, to suggestions that the ruling Zanu-PF party did not want the resignation to take place in the presence of army chiefs because that would look like a military takeover.

There has been widespread anger at what transpired but also trepidation among some that the longer Mr Mugabe stays in office, the more chance he will have to organise a counter coup. Around 100 MPs who support him did not turn up for the Zanu-PF meeting in which he was removed as leader and his wife Grace sacked as head of the party’s women’s section. There is also the recognition that the President retains support in some of rural areas.

The draft impeachment motion to be laid before parliament accuses Mr Mugabe of being “a source of instability” and of exhibiting a “disrespect for the law”. He is blamed for the economic failure of the past 15 years and also of abrogating the mandate of his office to promote Grace Mugabe who, opponents claim, is guilty of abuse and corruption.

In theory, impeachment would need the joint sitting of the Senate and the National Assembly, a sitting of a nine-member Senate committee, then another joint sitting to confirm the verdict with a two-thirds majority.

Some Zanu-PF officials have said it will take a week for the impeachment process to be completed. Secretary for legal affairs Paul Mangawana thought it would “take a maximum of two days, the charges are so clear”. The organisation Veritas, which provides legal and parliamentary information in Zimbabwe, said it will take “at least several days to complete”. But the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust maintained “they can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a day”.

​Zanu-PF MPs say they have the required numbers to get to the two-thirds for impeachment. However, talks are being held with opposition parties to send an “unanimous and unified message to Mugabe: your time is up”.

A massive rally took place against Mr Mugabe on Saturday. Activists say they are expecting an even bigger turnout for Tuesday’s march to the Mugabe mansion, the Blue Roof, which will take place while the MPs debate the impeachment motion.

Mr Mutsvangwa, who had called for the crowds to turn out on Saturday, declared: “This time we will not leave Harare and the streets until we see the back of Mugabe. Tomorrow is the day, while parliament is doing its business and dispensing with him, we call upon Zimbabweans to come in numbers to send the message to Mugabe.”

The protesters had gathered outside Mr Mugabe’s official home in the capital, State House, on Saturday but dispersed after being asked to do so by the army. “This time it will be a sit-in. It will be a sit-in, surround the place, until he is gone.”

Activists had called on the business community, trade unions and students to form a united front against Mr Mugabe. At the University of Zimbabwe students boycotted exams and demanded that a Phd awarded to Grace Mugabe should be revoked. The President’s wife is said to have received her doctorate in two months when the minimum time to acquire one is normally four years.

At the campus, Innocent Kagodora, 23, said: “There has, of course, been much more serious abuse than Grace and her doctorate, but it is an example of how laws and regulations were so easily broken by these people. We want Mugabe to go. It was disgraceful that he didn’t resign last night, so he will have to be forced.”

Makoni Tinotenda, reading business studies and computer studies, said: “We want to see Grace Mugabe prosecuted, like any other criminal. But the first thing would be to get Mugabe to accept he is not wanted. We will be marching tomorrow, it’ll be one of the best days of our lives.”",1
40,Treasury blacklists firms allegedly tied to drug lord,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted 20 entities and one person linked to a Mexican drug lord who was recently released on a technicality in the torture-murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent.

Rafael Caro Quintero has spent the last 28 years of a 40-year sentence locked up in a Mexican prison for the killing of Enrique “Kiki” Camarena.

Quintero was originally sentenced to spend 40 years behind bars, but was released on Aug. 9 with 12 years still left on his sentence.

Security guards were assigned to follow Quintero after his release, but the former cartel boss was able to quickly shake them, a source familiar with the events told FoxNews.com.

The details behind the unexpected release of Quintero have threatened an already fragile relationship between the U.S. and Mexico.

Authorities say Camarena was tortured before his execution -- viciously beaten, with his tormenters reportedly using a screwdriver to drill a hole in his head; a doctor was employed to keep him alive and conscious during the interrogation. A detailed 1985 Miami Herald report on the kidnapping said Camarena suffered a broken jaw, a broken nose, broken cheekbones and a crushed windpipe.

Camarena's body was later discovered, along with that of his Mexican pilot, on a ranch outside Guadalajara.

Quintero’s criminal career began in the late 1970s, when he founded one of the most notorious drug cartels in the country. During his illegal ventures, authorities say he “amassed an illicit fortune.”

While in prison, officials say Quintero kept up alliances with Mexican drug trafficking organizations and used a network of family members, front men and friends to invest the money he made illegally in legitimate companies and real estate investment deals.

U.S. authorities want to cut off the cash to Quintero and his associates. They had added him, 20 businesses he is associated with as well as Juan Carlos Soto Ruiz, a Guadalajaran native who manages six of the companies, to the list.

“Caro Quintero and his organizations can no longer hide behind front companies with their drug trafficking profits,” DEA spokeswoman Michele Leonhart said in a written statement. “These illegal enterprises fuel the drug trade and its violence and corruption. DEA and our partners at Treasury and elsewhere in government will pursue any and all means available to ensure that Caro Quintero is brought to justice and his criminal network is destroyed.”

Since 2000, the U.S. has identified 103 drug dealers and 1,300 businesses and individuals as part of the Kingpin Act.

The law prohibits companies and people in the U.S. from conducting any type of financial or commercial transaction with those on the list. Civil penalties can hit more than $1 million per violation. Criminal penalties for corporate officers caught breaking the law can result in fines up to $5 million and 30 years in prison.

In September, Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto as a way to strengthen the economic relationship between the neighboring nations.

There was no mention in their public press conference of Quintero’s release.",1

209,Pope Francis commits to clean finances amid scandal in backyard,"Pope Francis told European anti-money laundering experts Thursday that the Vatican was committed to clean finance, as he denounced financial speculation amid a spiraling corruption investigation in the heart of the Holy See.

It is rare for a head of state to meet with the Council of Europe's Moneyval teams, who make periodic on-site visits to member states to evaluate their adherence to international standards to fight money-laundering and terrorist financing.

But amid the Vatican's own financial scandal, which has exposed the Holy See's ineptitude in investing and managing donations from the faithful, Francis received the dozen members of the Moneyval team in a private audience in his library in the Apostolic Palace.

Citing Jesus' efforts to cast out the merchants from the temple, Francis praised the evaluators' work and policies aimed at monitoring movements of money and of intervening in cases where irregular or even criminal activities are detected.

The measures that you are evaluating are meant to promote a 'clean finance', in which the merchants are prevented from speculating in that sacred temple which, in accordance with the Creator's plan of love, is humanity, Francis said.

The pope didn't mention the scandal in his own backyard, but it couldn't have been far from the evaluators' minds given the headlines of recent weeks and months that have thrown the Vatican into chaos.

Francis last month fired the former No. 2 in the secretariat of state, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, after revelations that he wired 100,000 euros (USD 117,000) in Holy See funds to a charity controlled by his brother. Becciu also recommended the Italian bishops' conference donate some 300,000 euros to the same fund.

Becciu has admitted he sent the money and made the recommendation, but denied any wrongdoing and insisted that the money was meant for the charity, not his brother.

Becciu's ouster came amid an investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the secretariat of state's investment into a luxury London real estate venture that to date has cost the Vatican 350 million euros, much of it donations from the faithful.

Becciu was involved in the initial investment, but his successor - the current No. 2 in the secretariat of state - actually authorized payments of tens of millions of euros in fees to the allegedly unscrupulous middlemen most implicated in the venture.

Vatican prosecutors have been investigating the London investment for over a year, but haven't handed down any indictments. Given Vatican officials signed contracts giving voting control and management fees to the middlemen, it's unclear what if any crimes might have been committed.

Italian newspapers have been rife with reports about the Vatican's other financial investments, including in risky, speculative funds controlled by the middlemen.

Francis has previously defended the Vatican's decision to invest donations in real estate, saying that keeping the money in a safe wouldn't generate necessary interest to keep the capital from losing its value.

But Francis has also denounced the profit-at-all-cost mentality of today's global economy, and cited his own documents denouncing financial speculation and the idolatry of money that has taken root.

Sometimes, in the effort to amass wealth, there is little concern for where it comes from, the more or less legitimate activities that may have produced it, and the mechanisms of exploitation that may be behind it, he told the Moneyval evaluators Thursday.

Thus, situations can occur where, in touching money, we get blood on our hands, the blood of our brothers and sisters.

683,Indiana mayor indicted over alleged bribe for contract,"MUNCIE, Ind. — A central Indiana mayor was arrested Monday after being indicted for allegedly taking a $5,000 bribe in exchange for a public contract.

The theft of government funds charge unsealed Monday alleges Muncie Mayor Dennis Tyler accepted the bribe from an unidentified company in exchange for the awarding of public works projects in Muncie.

The indictment handed down last week said the 76-year-old mayor received the cash through Tracy Barton, the Muncie Sanitary District’s former superintendent of sewer maintenance and engineering. Barton was indicted last year on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, falsification of documents and witness tampering.

The bribe was paid sometime between 2014 and Aug. 25, 2016, the indictment said.

Tyler was arrested at his home Monday morning, FBI spokeswoman Chris Bavender said.

Tyler was arraigned Monday and an automatic not guilty plea was entered for him, U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said at a news conference. Tyler was later released from custody.

“Public officials are entrusted to perform a public service and to legitimately conduct business in the best interest of the community that they represent,” Minkler said. “Tyler not only betrayed the trust of his community, but violated federal law, and all in an effort to serve his own personal interests. My office intends to prosecute Tyler to the full extent of the law.”

The charge Tyler faces carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a $250,000 fine, Minkler said.

Tyler is a Democrat who has been mayor for eight years after serving in the Indiana House. He did not seek reelection this year. It wasn’t immediately known whether he had a lawyer.

Tyler’s indictment came amid an ongoing federal investigation that has resulted in Muncie's former building commissioner pleading guilty to money laundering and wire fraud. Craig Nichols was sentenced earlier this year to two years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $218,000 in restitution to the City of Muncie, the Muncie Sanitary District and developer Dannar Construction.

Prosecutors alleged Nichols used sham bidding practices and submitting fake invoices to steer work to companies he owned and then billed the city more than $376,000 for demolition work that was either never performed or performed at inflated prices.",1
367,"Six arrested, lawmaker sought, over alleged Kosovo land scam","PRISTINA (Reuters) - Police in Kosovo arrested six people as part of an investigation into an alleged land scam that cost the state 30 million euros ($34 million), European Union investigators said on Wednesday.

Azem Syla, a prominent legislator from the ruling party, was the alleged leader of the fraud which is believed to have involved 40 people, the EU police mission in Kosovo said.

Syla, a former leader of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas who fought Serb forces during the 1998-99 war to gain independence from Serbia, remains at large and police failed to find him during a 10-day search.

About 350 officers were involved and 42 locations were raided by police wearing masks. EU investigators were also involved in the biggest operation against crime in years.

“The investigation relates to a large-scale organized criminal group, active from 2006 to date, composed of Kosovo and Serbian citizens, and headed by Azem Syla,” the EU police and justice mission said in a statement.

“The case involves the criminal offences of organized crime; money laundering; abuse of official position; falsifying official documents and giving and receiving bribes.”

The probe involves officials and business people who bought and sold state-owned land in an industrial zone near the capital Pristina.

Participants in the scheme are alleged to have acquired the land cheaply before selling it for a large profit, depriving the state of 30 million euros in lost revenues.

Syla could not be reached for comment.

The EU police and justice mission, called EULEX, arrived in Kosovo in 2008, when the small Balkan country declared independence, to help fight organized crime and corruption, and to handle war crimes cases.

EULEX has faced criticism in Kosovo and outside for not doing enough to tackle crime and corruption in one of the poorest countries in Europe.

Efforts to investigate former fighters have often failed because clan loyalties run deep and KLA rebels are revered as heroes by Kosovo Albanians. Many entered government after the war.",1
536,"Bogus stockbroker James Bufton jailed for £250,000 fraud","Published

A bogus stockbroker who conned family, friends and investors out of more than £250,000 and spent it on strippers and helicopter rides, has been jailed.

James Bufton, 26, from Newport, was described at the city's crown court as the ""lowest form of human being"".

Bufton, who has been made bankrupt also admitted trying to defraud HM Revenue and Customs out of just under £1.3m.

He was sentenced to six years in prison after admitting several counts of fraud.

The court heard he boasted on social media about drinking expensive Cristal champagne, spending hundreds of pounds on alcohol in nightclubs and posted an image of himself with the singer Rihanna.

During his sentencing, the court was told Bufton defrauded his own aunt and uncle.

His 62-year-old aunt, who is now living on Universal Credit, said she willingly gave him the money because she ""believed him to be a successful stockbroker"".

Strip club spending

Days after his uncle died from cancer, Bufton faked his voice to get hold of his £70,000 pension.

Prosecutor Tim Evans said Bufton ""spent a lot of time and an awful lot of money"" in the Fantasy Lounge strip club.

Bufton had pretended to be a Goldman Sachs trained stockbroker, but Mr Evans said he was in fact ""a conman"".

He defrauded his ex-girlfriend's parents before eventually being confronted by them.

The court heard Bufton orchestrated ""a cacophony of lies"" pretending to operate a company based in Regents Park, London, but actually worked out of his parents' terraced home in Newport.

Bufton used other people's money to pay for stays at the Celtic Manor hotel and a helicopter to the Cheltenham Festival.

He was arrested in 2016 but continued to defraud people, including his father's best friend of 40 years Simon Thomas.

Mr Thomas gave Bufton £30,000 to fight his legal case but he spent that money on ""one big jolly"".

He was then persuaded to invest a further £20,000 in another bogus venture.

Bricks through window

In an impact statement, Mr Thomas described Bufton as ""the lowest form of human being"".

Bufton admitted fraud by abuse of position, fraud by false representation and possession of articles for use in fraud and money laundering.

The court heard he then committed a large VAT fraud to try and pay people he had conned as part of his investor fraud.

Mr Evans said the defendant tried to ""falsely claim repayments of tax to which his companies were not entitled"".

He was arrested for a second time in 2018.

In mitigation the court heard Bufton had apologised to his victims and had received threats against him and his family, including bricks being thrown through their windows.",1

PRESS RELEASE:

A Georgia woman who operated a telemedicine network through two companies has admitted to participation in an ever-growing healthcare and telemedicine fraud scheme.

Charlene Frame, the operator of Royal Physician Network, LLC, and Envision It Perfect, LLC, both Georgia companies, pled guilty in U.S. District Court to a charge of Conspiracy for conspiring to pay medical providers, such as physicians and nurse practitioners, in exchange for obtaining orders for durable medical equipment (DME) that would then be sold to DME providers and, ultimately, billed to Medicare, said Bobby L. Christine, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.

The financial total for orders facilitated through this scheme is alleged in court documents to be in excess of $60 million for thousands of patient orders. Medicare beneficiaries were located in the Southern District of Georgia and elsewhere.

“Charlene Frame used her network of companies to blatantly defraud the government’s insurance safety net for seniors,” said U.S. Attorney Christine. “We will not tolerate such greed-fueled theft from these programs, and will continue to root out these despicable frauds.”

This prosecution, arising out of the related “Operation Brace Yourself” and “Operation Double Helix,” together with 25 other previously announced cases, involve the largest fraud operation in the history of the Southern District of Georgia. Those charged in this string of cases include eight physicians, two nurse practitioners, two other operators of different telemedicine companies, three brokers of patient data, and several owners of durable medical equipment companies. The Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries whose identities were used as part of the scheme are located throughout the country, including throughout the Southern District of Georgia.

The combined $480 million in fraud charged in the Southern District of Georgia is part of nationwide operations by the Department of Justice that thus far has included allegations involving billions of fraudulent claims for genetic testing, orthotic braces, pain creams, and other items.

“Frame’s fraud scheme of $60-million has put tremendous strain on our federally-subsidized health care programs and it is only a small part of a much larger operation,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “She will be held accountable for her greed and the affect it has had on our tax paying citizens, especially those who need government assistance for their health care needs.”

“Paying kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals is a dangerous and illegal practice,” said Derrick L. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General in Atlanta. “The OIG, in concert with our law enforcement partners, is dedicated to ensuring that patient referrals are based on sound medical advice and not financial remuneration.”

“This type of corruption involving health care fraud against Medicare has managed to defraud American taxpayers of millions upon millions of dollars,” said Resident Agent in Charge Glen M. Kessler of the U.S. Secret Service. “The U.S. Secret Service and our partners are always willing to take prompt and coordinated actions to hold these telemarketers and medical professionals responsible for placing personal greed above the good of the public, particularly in light of our nation’s current struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic.”

This investigation is ongoing. As telemedicine becomes an increasing part of our healthcare system, vigilance in ensuring that fraud and kickbacks do not usurp the legitimate practice of medicine by electronic means is more important than ever. If you are aware of any fraud or kickbacks relating to telemedicine, including COVID-19 fraud, please call the FBI hotline at 1-800-CALL-FBI.",1
414,Mexican ex-security minister hit with new charge in U.S. corruption case,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Former top Mexican security official Genaro Garcia Luna, accused in the United States of taking bribes to help a top drug gang operate freely, has been hit with a new charge that could add 20 years to his sentence if convicted, prosecutors said Thursday.

Garcia Luna, a minister during the term of former President Felipe Calderon, now faces a charge of “engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,” the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said.

In January, Garcia Luna pleaded not guilty to accusations of drug trafficking conspiracy and making false statements.

Two former law enforcement officials who worked under Garcia Luna were also each charged with three counts of cocaine trafficking, the DOJ said on Thursday.

Luis Cardenas Palomino, 51, and Ramon Pequeno Garcia, 53, are both at large.

“In exchange for multimillion-dollar bribes, the defendants allegedly permitted the Sinaloa Cartel to operate with impunity in Mexico,” the DOJ said in a statement.

Cesar De Castro, Garcia Luna’s lawyer listed in court filings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Garcia Luna, 51, whose case is in federal court in New York, and his two ex-officers are accused of having used their high-ranking posts to allow illegal drug trafficking.

The trio is also suspected of providing sensitive information to the cartel and its rivals to facilitate the crimes.

Prosecutors say the defendants put officials in power in certain areas controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel, once led by convicted kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.

The cartel delivered bribes to Garcia Luna in briefcases on at least two occasions, according to prosecutors.

If convicted, the three former officials could face up to life in prison.

The new charge against Garcia Luna could trigger a minimum 20 years behind bars. He had previously been facing a minimum sentence of 10 years.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador last May urged U.S. authorities to probe Garcia Luna’s case from within both governments.",1

TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS — The number of murders the Honduran drug lord admitted to orchestrating over 10 years was stunning.

The dead included people he described as killers, rapists and gang members. Then there were the innocents: a lawyer, two journalists, a Honduran refugee in Canada, an official who was serving as Honduras’s antidrug czar and a politician who became his adviser; there were even two children caught in a shootout.

In all, the drug lord, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, said that, working in concert with drug traffickers and others, he had “caused” the deaths of 78 people — a number that posed a dilemma for United States officials when Mr. Rivera came to them offering to expose high-level corruption in this Central American nation of some nine million people.

Knowing that he was already in the sights of United States investigators, Mr. Rivera sought to help the Drug Enforcement Administration root out corrupt Honduran politicians and other elites who had made Honduras a gateway for massive amounts of cocaine headed for the United States through Mexico.

The offer came at a time when United States officials were deeply concerned by Honduras’s slide into anarchy. A stalwart ally and home to a United States military base, Honduras was plagued by drug traffickers and gangs and had one of the world’s highest homicide rates. It is the first landing point for about 80 percent of suspected drug flights departing from South America, the State Department has said.

But to sign Mr. Rivera to a formal cooperation agreement meant the government would most likely have to do something for him: seek leniency on his behalf, which could spare him a long prison sentence and leave the families of the Honduran victims believing that Mr. Rivera got away with murder.

Today, four years after Mr. Rivera’s clandestine cooperation began, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have with his help charged seven police officers from Honduras’s national force, along with the son of the country’s former president and several members of a prominent Honduran banking family.

The evidence, a prosecutor said at a hearing on Sept. 5, showed nothing short of “state-sponsored drug trafficking.”

Investigators have also gathered evidence that Honduras’s former president, Porfirio Lobo, took bribes to protect traffickers, and that drug money may have helped finance the rise of the country’s current president, Juan Orlando Hernández.

Neither politician has been charged and, through representatives, both vigorously denied the allegations to The New York Times.

Here in the capital city, which sits in a bowl ringed by mountains, there has been much speculation about who will next face charges in New York, some of it fueled by the American embassy, which took the unusual step of posting a list of Hondurans, including current military officers, under investigation for drug trafficking and corruption.

Prosecutors have long enlisted cooperators with violent backgrounds to achieve the greater goal of taking down a Mafia leader or some violent gang. Salvatore Gravano, the former underboss of the Gambino crime family in New York who became a government informer, admitted to killing 19 people.

In the Honduras case, prosecutors who approved the agreement with Mr. Rivera and a second deal with his brother, Javier, say the men offered a rare opportunity to expose the links between drug traffickers and Honduran politicians and businessmen.

“The illegal drug trade in Honduras not only infected much of its civil society, including the highest levels of government and its financial sector, but also brought frightening levels of violence on its people,” Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement.

Details of Devis Rivera’s cooperation, which included surreptitiously recording Honduran targets, emerged in March when he testified over two days against Fabio Lobo, the former Honduran president’s son. Mr. Lobo was recently sentenced to 24 years in prison for cocaine conspiracy.

Murdering a General

The Rivera brothers, who led a trafficking organization called Los Cachiros, built a fortune as middlemen, moving cocaine from hidden airstrips northward to the Mexican cartels.

The brothers used violence to muscle out rivals and others, from at least 2003 when Devis Rivera was involved in the murder of a hospital security guard and, the next year, the killing of the man he had been guarding, a Honduran cartel leader.

By late 2009, Mr. Rivera testified that he and other traffickers felt threatened by Gen. Julián Arístides González Irías, the Honduran counternarcotics czar. The American embassy in Tegucigalpa once described General Arístides González as the “ last (somewhat) best hope ” to revive Honduras’s counternarcotics efforts, according to a cable published by WikiLeaks.

“The decision was made to kill him,” Mr. Rivera testified. General Arístides González was assassinated on Dec. 8, 2009 by a gunman on a motorcycle.

Mr. Rivera testified that the traffickers paid $200,000 to $300,000 for the killing, which was handled by a group of police officers.

Image

That was around the same time, Mr. Rivera testified, that he and his brother bought a president.

Concerned about the possibility of extradition to the United States, Mr. Rivera said they paid more than $400,000 in bribes to President Porfirio Lobo, before and after his November 2009 election. At President Lobo’s home in early 2010, Mr. Rivera received the assurance he wanted.

“The president said to me to tell my brother not to worry,” Mr. Rivera recalled, “because during his four-year term nobody would get extradited.”

President Lobo also designated his son Fabio, who was once a juvenile court judge, “as a middleman who would be able to protect us, help us — the Cachiros,” Mr. Rivera said.

Fabio Lobo became a valuable ally. “I gave him a bribe almost every time I met with him,” Mr. Rivera said. “I knew that having him with me, everything would go well.”

One time, the president’s son, riding with his armed security detail in a convoy of blue Prado SUVs, escorted 1,000 kilograms of cocaine for the brothers through a police checkpoint.

He “lowered the windows a little bit and then started talking with the police officers,” Mr. Rivera recalled.

By Mr. Rivera’s account, the president’s son threw himself into his new role, asking to visit a backcountry airstrip to “feel the adrenaline — what you experience when you receive a plane loaded with drugs.”

“I’d do anything for you,” Fabio Lobo said in one recorded conversation. “I’ll go to the moon and back for you.”

Image

With President Lobo’s patronage, the brothers invested in construction companies that competed for government contracts. In the fashion of Pablo Escobar, they opened a zoo, complete with tigers, jaguars, and lions. The brothers also developed relationships with one of the country’s most prominent families, the Rosenthals, who acted as their bankers and money launderers. They invested drug proceeds in cattle, with their beef later exported to the United States, and agriculture.

Brian H. Bieber, a lawyer for former President Lobo, said his client remains under investigation by the American authorities. He said that the situation has been frustrating for Mr. Lobo, who has been “loud and clear in his emphatic denial” of Mr. Rivera’s allegations.

“There is absolutely no credible evidence to support the allegations made by an admitted mass murderer and a convicted drug trafficker,” Mr. Bieber said, adding that the former president had “absolutely no” relationship with the Cachiros.

As President Lobo’s term neared its end in 2013, Mr. Rivera had new concerns.

The United States Treasury Department had announced sanctions against the Rivera brothers, and Honduran authorities began seizing their assets, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even their zoo.

“I was afraid for my life. I was afraid for my family,” Mr. Rivera testified. “I could get killed because I had worked with politicians, police officers.”

By December 2013, Mr. Rivera testified, he and his brother Javier had begun talking with the D.E.A. and prosecutors to try to strike a deal.

A Devil’s Bargain

Prosecutors wrestled with the idea of granting a deal to men who had killed so many people, particularly innocents, according to current and former government officials.

Little has been said about how that deal began. On Dec. 5, 2013, Mr. Rivera and his lawyer met with the D.E.A. and at least one prosecutor at a secret session in Belize, according to one document. In all, about 20 sessions were held, the document shows.

“We were trying to corroborate what they were telling us, obviously, through that process,” a senior D.E.A. official said.

One official said prosecutors were not aware of how many murders Mr. Rivera had been involved in — only his role in drug trafficking — until after the discussions began.

Under a cooperation deal, the brothers would have to admit to — and plead guilty to — all murders and other crimes they had ever committed, even those the authorities were unaware of. That would sweep in killings that might otherwise go unaccounted for in Honduras.

Image

“A guilty plea as part of cooperation is often the only way the defendant can be held accountable,” Mr. Kim, the acting United States attorney, said, speaking generally.

Mr. Rivera’s agreement shows that if he fulfilled his end of the deal, prosecutors would seek leniency at his sentencing. He may also be placed in the witness protection program, the document says. Some of his relatives have already been permitted to move to the United States, Mr. Rivera testified.

The extent of the Rivera brothers’ assistance continues to become public in court proceedings. This summer, the government filed a D.E.A. search warrant application showing that in 2013, Mr. Rivera secretly recorded a conversation with another Honduran trafficker who claimed to have made a $250,000 payment intended for Juan Orlando Hernández, who later became Honduras’s president. The document does not indicate that Mr. Hernández ever received the money.

Mr. Hernández’ office responded that it was unaware, until an inquiry by The Times, of this allegation in the D.E.A. document. It attributed the claim to drug traffickers who have been targeted by Mr. Hernández’s own government’s anti-narcotics campaign.

Image

“It is logical and even predictable that criminals who have been damaged by the actions of our government feel hatred and resentment against those who have made those decisions,” Mr. Hernández’s office wrote in a statement.

The president’s office said that the administration’s fight against drug traffickers has resulted in 14 extraditions and the destruction of 150 clandestine landing strips.

During President Hernández’s tenure, Honduras’s murder rate has fallen. About a third of the police force has been dismissed following revelations of some officers’ roles in drug-related assassinations.

Still, a recent State Department report observed that in Honduras, “new criminal bosses have emerged to assume leadership of dismantled networks to continue cocaine smuggling and other forms of crime.”

Mr. Rivera has indicated he has lived up to his end of the bargain.

“What I did was confess all the crimes that I have committed,” he testified. “The work I have done with them has been to give them information, all the information I knew, about my work with drug trafficking and politicians.”

Contaminated Justice

In Honduras, there is relief Mr. Rivera is facing justice in New York.

“They should be judged here, but by whom?” said Hilda Caldera, the widow of Alfredo Landaverde, a politician and counternarcotics official who was assassinated in December 2011 — one of the murders to which Mr. Rivera has pleaded guilty. “The justice here is contaminated.”

In an interview at the national university where she teaches, Ms. Caldera said her husband had been willing to declare what few others would say publicly: that traffickers had infiltrated the police and military.

“He was alone, so alone, in talking about this,” she said.

Mr. Landaverde’s name appears on a spreadsheet, titled Appendix A, that is part of Mr. Rivera’s plea agreement. The three-page document lists the 78 murders through 2013 that Mr. Rivera admitted involvement in.

Image

The names of 49 victims are listed only partially or as “FNU LNU” — first and last names unknown — and other details where available.

One was “an assassin believed to have worked for the Echeverria-Ramos family.” Several were “suspected” murderers and rapists.

Twenty-nine victims are named in full, including Mr. Landaverde, the 51st entry.

One victim’s father, Heriberto Palacios, said he long doubted that whoever ordered the killing of his son, Nahum, would be held to account, and he was uneasy at the prospect of leniency for the Rivera brothers, given “all of the evil they did in Honduras.”

His son had been a prominent television and radio reporter, an advocate for farmers locked in a bloody struggle with large landowners. In 2010, Nahum and his girlfriend, Yorleny Sánchez, a doctor, were fatally shot near his home. They are victims Nos. 23 and 24.

Mr. Palacios, a retired farm laborer, said he had once gone to a local government office to inquire about his son’s murder investigation. He said officials refused to provide any information, lest he “might misinterpret it.”

95,Wife of Putin’s Number Two Man Gets Rich Quick,"by
Above: The Appleby building in the Cayman Islands, where Marina Sechina's company was registered. Credit: Arch and Godfrey

Marina Sechina was once married to the second-most powerful man in Russia. Her ex-husband, Igor Sechin, has been a devoted subordinate to Russian President Vladimir Putin for more than 25 years.

Since asset declarations began in 2008, Sechina had no personal income, no significant assets, and was not involved in any businesses until 2013. Now things have changed.

Sechin is important in Russia. When Putin became vice-mayor of St. Petersburg in 1991, Sechin was his chief of staff, and when Putin left St. Petersburg for Moscow in 1996, Sechin was quick to follow. “When I moved to Moscow, [Sechin] asked [me] to take him with me. And I took him,” Putin wrote in his autobiography, First Person.

Since then, Sechin has continued to follow every step Putin took up the ladder to power. From 2004 until 2008, he was deputy chief of Putin’s administration. When Putin headed the government in 2008, Sechin was appointed deputy prime minister. In 2012, he was appointed head of the oil giant Rosneft.

Sechin is not known as a friendly, jovial character. In fact, his ruthless, icy demeanor and ties to the secret services have earned him the media nickname “the Darth Vader of Russian politics.” Yet in modern Russia, his name can open many doors and solve many problems.

This can be both a boon and a burden to someone building a business empire.

After Sechin and his wife divorced in 2011, she might have concluded that his name was more help than hindrance because she did not take back her maiden name, sticking with “Sechina” instead. Like Coke, Kalashnikov, or other well-known brand names, it could be the most valuable asset in her rapidly growing business empire.

And yet, there’s a problem. For years, as a public servant, her ex-husband was required to disclose his and his wife’s incomes. Until 2011, Sechin reported zero income for his wife in his annual declarations (and no extravagant amounts for himself).

But after their divorce, Sechina started acquiring stakes in telecom, electricity, agriculture, and real estate companies in Russia. Though her name had never been associated with any major companies or other sources of income that would point to any large wealth, in 2013 alone she acquired stakes in a number of Russian companies that showed assets worth over €55 million (US$ 76.7 million) on their balance sheets by the end of that year.

And it wasn’t only in Russia. It appears that one of the first things Sechina did after her divorce was to establish a company in the Cayman Islands. Its purpose was to invest in a Russian real estate project run by businessman and banker Julius Meinl V, the heir of the global coffee empire, who expected investors to contribute tens of millions of euros. Meinl had previously been accused of defrauding investors.

Documents detailing Sechina’s Cayman business come from a massive leak of internal data from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda. The data was leaked to the German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which organized a global collaboration with hundreds of media partners around the world, including the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

It is not known whether the planned investments actually took place. Neither Sechina nor Meinl responded to requests for comment.

If Sechina reported no significant income before she joined the business world, where did she get the money for these plans?

It’s possible that she received a settlement from her husband after their divorce – but reporters found no large properties or other major assets in her possession in 2012 that would explain her ability to make significant real estate investments.

Her husband’s declared income in the years prior to her divorce was also not very large.

Going Offshore

According to Appleby’s internal documents, the Cayman company of which Sechina was the ultimate beneficiary was called S Holdings Ltd.

The Cayman Islands lie south of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea, about 450 miles from Miami, Florida. Three hundred years ago, the notorious pirates Henry Morgan and Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, operated in these waters; it is believed their buried treasure is still secreted on the islands.

Secrecy and big money remained a Caymans specialty until recently, when the jurisdiction began to cooperate more closely with tax authorities around the world. But in terms of company ownership, it remains among the most popular and secretive offshore locations in the world.

In 2012, Sechina’s company was established with the help of officers from Austria’s Meinl Bank, part of the business empire of Meinl, the coffee heir. According to the Appleby documents, his bank managers intended for Sechina’s company to invest in Meinl’s real estate business, which specialized in Russia and Eastern Europe. But the files provide no evidence that the bank or Appleby ever inquired into the origin of Sechina’s money.

The proposed investment into Meinl’s businesses wasn’t cheap. A PowerPoint presentation and a plan to invite investors to join the project suggested possible amounts starting at €40 million ($55.6 million). This project marked the banker’s attempt to attract additional funding to his second try investing in Russian and Eastern European real estate.",1
622,"Fifa official took bribes to back Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, court hears","A senior Fifa official took at least $1m in bribes to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup, a witness testified in court on Tuesday, as part of a broad investigation into corruption at Fifa.

Julio Grondona, a senior vice-president at Fifa and head of the Argentinian football association until his death in 2014, allegedly told the witness, Alejandro Burzaco, an Argentinian sports marketing executive, that he was owed the money in exchange for his vote, which helped Qatar secure the lucrative tournament.

Qatar’s victory, announced in December 2010 after four rounds of knockout voting by Fifa’s 22-person executive committee in Zurich, has been plagued with allegations of bribery and misconduct. The sworn testimony, given in a New York City court on Tuesday, is some of the strongest evidence the 2022 vote was tainted.

Burzaco, the former CEO of the Argentinian sports marketing executive Torneos y Competencias, has pleaded guilty to handing out millions of dollars in bribes to senior South American football officials in exchange for broadcast rights to major regional tournaments.

His testimony on Tuesday alleges a sustained program of annual and one-off bribes, often over $1m a time, to a group of influential executives on South American football’s governing body, Conmebol, over a period of about a decade.

Burzaco testified that while he was arranging a $1m bribe payment to Grondona and another $1m bribe to another senior Fifa executive, Ricardo Teixeira, Grondona informed Burzaco he had taken a bribe for his World Cup vote. In total, the former executive said, he had arranged $15m in bribes for securing the rights to the Copa América, which at that point were held by a rival marketing company.

Burzaco said that Grondona told him in January 2011 to also pay him Teixeria’s $1m Copa América bribe, which the Brazilian “owed him” as “Grondona voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup”.

The marketing executive had accompanied Grondona, Teixeira and Nicolás Leoz, then the Conmebol president, to Zurich for the vote in 2010 and had heard of their intention to back Qatar.

“It was not a private thing,” Burzaco said.

As the voting got under way, Burzaco said Grondona told him that Leoz had initially voted for Japan and then South Korea. During a break, he and Teixeira then pulled Leoz aside to “shake him up” and ask: “What the hell are you doing? Are you the one not voting for Qatar?” When the officials returned for the next vote, Leoz backed Qatar, Burzaco said.

The former marketing executive said that Grondona had not told him the total amount of money he accepted to make the Qatar vote or who the source of the bribe was. But he claimed to have witnessed an altercation between Grondona and Qatari officials at a Fifa event months later where the football executive was furious at news reports implicating him in corrupt dealings and insinuated he had been underpaid for his vote.

“Basically, Grondona told them [the Qatari officials]: you will pay me $80m or write a letter saying you never paid me,” Burzaco said.

Burzaco’s evidence portrayed the Argentinian executive as a kingmaker in Conmebol’s allegedly corrupt enterprise. The marketing executive said Grondona personally approved the bribes he and five other senior Conmebol officials were paid for regional tournament rights, often dictating the amounts – frequently seven-figure sums – and taking cuts for himself.

Burzaco would frequently travel with Grondona from Argentina to Conmebol’s headquarters in Luque in Paraguay, where “three or four Mercedes” would wait for them by the runway and take them straight from the plane, allowing them to skip customs, as “someone would take care of that”.

When Grondona arrived at the headquarters, Leoz would fly “40 or 50 Argentine flags around the building” to greet him. Teixeira, who resigned as president of Brazil’s federation amid corruption allegations in 2012, would receive the same treatment.

Burzaco’s testimony, which is expected to continue into Wednesday, also implicated the three former football executives, José Maria Marín, Manuel Burga and Juan Ángel Napout, currently on trial.

The three former officials, some of whom went on to replace Grondona, Teixeira and Leoz at the head of Conmebol, deny their role in the alleged 24-year scheme involving at least $150m in bribes.

As his testimony commenced on Tuesday morning, Burzaco was asked to point out the three defendants in the courtroom while testifying that he bribed all of them.

The witness described a series of meeting at hotels and restaurants in Buenos Aires starting in 2012 in which he helped strike deals for annual six-figure bribes for Maín, who replaced Teixeira as president of Brazil’s soccer federation; Burga, former president of Peru’s soccer federation; and Napout, ex-head of Paraguay’s soccer federation.

After one meeting where arrangements were made to wire Marín a portion of a $2m bribe, Marín “gave me a hug and showed me his gratitude”, Burzaco said. At another, Burga “told me he was happy collecting the bribes”, he said.

After being charged in 2015, following a morning raid on a hotel in Zurich, Burzaco testified that he briefly went into hiding before deciding to turn himself in and cooperate.

“I said, ‘Alejandro, you go to the United States and face justice,’” he said about the decision. “‘Accept responsibility.’”

The former marketing executive also claimed that several of the region’s best-known broadcasters that he had partnered with had paid bribes to football officials to secure rights to games. This included Fox Sports, partnered with Burzaco in the T&T sports marketing company, which owned the rights to the Copa Libertadores. Fox held a 75% share ofT&T from 2005, Burzaco said.

The court was presented with a sham contract written by T&T Sports and signed by the former Fox Pan American Sports chief operating officer James Ganley, which Burzaco said was created to pay out $3.7m in bribes to Conmebol officials to keep the rights to the tournament.

Fox Sports denied that the company had been aware of or approved bribes, saying in a statement: “Fox Sports had no operational control of the entity which Burzaco ran. The entity run by Burzaco was a subsidiary of Fox Pan American Sports, which in 2008, at the time of the contract in question, was majority owned by a private equity firm and under their operational and management control.”

739,Broadcom co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III charged with drug trafficking following Las Vegas arrest,"CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device

Orange County tech billionaire Henry T. Nicholas III was charged Wednesday, Feb. 13 with multiple drug possession and trafficking charges in connection with a 2018 arrest at a Las Vegas hotel room where police found suspected heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, mushrooms and ecstasy.

Nicholas, co-founder of the chipmaker Broadcom, was arrested Aug. 7 along with a woman, Ashley Fargo, according to a police report obtained by the Southern California News Group.

Police were summoned to the hotel because Nicholas was having difficulty opening the door to his room and became concerned about the welfare of Fargo who was inside and failed to answer the door, according to the report.

When police entered the room, they found Fargo unresponsive and lying on a bed with a semi-deflated balloon in her mouth. A canister of nitrous oxide that Nicholas claimed was for recreational use was found in the corner of the room, according to police.

“The sort of use mentioned by Nicholas explained the balloon in Fargo’s mouth, as this is a common way to ingest nitrous-oxide as an inhalant known as whippets or poppers,” the report says.

Police said they also found two cases in the room that contained what appeared to be marijuana and bags of powder and other substances believed to be narcotics.

Nicholas and Fargo were charged Wednesday in Clark County Justice Court with five counts of trafficking and two counts of possessing a controlled substance.

David Z. Chesnoff, an attorney representing Nicholas, said his client and Fargo deny the charges.

“The charges are only allegations and not facts,” he said. “The actual facts are that Dr. Nicholas is a philanthropist, an advocate for victim’s rights, a scientist and co-founder of a global company. He is not a drug trafficker. We plan to file a motion to dismiss the entire matter on a number of grounds, including lack of evidence.”

Nicholas co-founded Broadcom in the 1990s and left the company in 2003. Recently, he has been bankrolling ballot measures in the U.S. that aim to guarantee certain rights to crime victims.

His estate is estimated to be worth $3.1 billion by Forbes magazine, which says Nicholas kept a 3 percent stake in the company. Broadcom was acquired by Singapore-based chip firm Avago in February 2016 for $37 billion in cash and stock and was renamed Broadcom Ltd. Formerly based in Irvine, the company has since moved its headquarters to San Jose.

Nicholas has struggled with illicit drug charges in the past. In June 2008, he was charged with four counts of distributing illegal drugs and 21 counts that he presided over a conspiracy to inflate and improperly account for $2.2 billion in Broadcom employee stock options, leading to the largest financial restatement of its kind in U.S. history.

He pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which later were dismissed.

But by then, the case had made national headlines. A profile in Vanity Fair had the title: “Dr. Nicholas and Mr. Hyde: Sex, Lies and Underground Lairs.”

The court filings in the past case painted Nicholas as a ruthless entrepreneur who slipped drugs to competitors without their knowledge, who threatened the lives of employees he believed had turned against him, who had the means and motive to flee beyond the reach of justice in his private jet.

Among the allegations: Nicholas and his entourage once smoked so much marijuana aboard his personal jet that the pilot donned an oxygen mask, the drug indictment said; Nicholas entertained clients with prostitutes, cocaine and “ecstasy”; Nicholas built a secret lair for sex and drug orgies.

After the charges were dropped, Nicholas set out to clear his name.

A longtime philanthropist, he donated time and money to his children’s school, St. Margaret’s Episcopal in San Juan Capistrano and supported the Nicholas Academic Centers, a program for underprivileged urban students.

Other organizations benefiting from Nicholas’ largesse included Habitat for Humanity, a small-business incubator called Chefs Center of California, the Episcopal Church, Opera Pacific, the Pacific Symphony, the Ocean Institute, engineering and computer science programs at UCI, the Oakland Military Institute, and the Mt. Olive School for girls in Kenya.

Nicholas also bankrolled California’s Marsy’s Law, a bill of rights for victims of violent crime named after his sister, who was slain by an ex-boyfriend in 1983. Nicholas backed the initiative with $4.9 million in campaign contributions.

336,Treasury designates drug trafficker Fernain Rodriguez Vasquez,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Colombian Fernain Rodriguez Vasquez was designated a significant foreign narcotics trafficker subject to sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control also designated seven other people and five entities that acted on behalf of Rodriguez Vasquez and provided support for his drug trafficking activities, the department said in a release.

""Drug trafficker Fernain Rodriguez Vazquez and his network have moved massive quantities of drugs for some of the most violent drug trafficking organizations in the Western Hemisphere, including the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel,"" OFAC Director Adam Szubin said. ""These sanctions will expose Rodriguez Vazquez's illicit network of agents and front companies and exclude them from the legitimate financial system.""

Rodriguez Vasquez leads an international drug-trafficking and money-laundering organization in Colombia that exported nearly 100 tons of cocaine annually, the Treasury Department said.

Wednesday's action seizes property and interests in property in the United States or in the possession or control of Americans, and bars U.S. citizens for engaging in transactions with Rodriguez Vazquez, the seven other people or the five other entities.",1
431,"Roman Abramovich symbolises 'rich debauchery' that has plagued corrupt Russia, claims former leader Mikhail Gorbachev","Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has today launched a scathing attack on Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich as a symbol of Russia's 'rich debauchery'.

The 79-year-old statesman also blasted the Kremlin, claiming he has been banned from staging a political comeback, and saying he was 'ashamed' of his country's two most powerful men Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev.

He accused the ruling classes indifference to real people and their problems, forgetting the principles that the country was built upon.

'They are rich and debauched. Their ideal is to be something close to Abramovich,' he said.

'I scorn this idea. I am ashamed of this rich debauchery. I am ashamed for us and the country.'

He hit out at the Kremlin's chief ideologue - Vladislav Surkov - who he said had vetoed his plans for setting up a Social Democratic Party in Russia.

'When Surkov found out, he asked: 'Why do you need this? In any case, we are not going to register your party', said the architect of the glasnost and perestroika revolutions which led to the end of the Soviet Union almost two decades ago.

Surkov is seen as the brains behind the centralised, authoritarian system that has emerged in Russia since Putin - now prime minister - came to power 11 years ago.

The ex-Soviet leader complained: 'Just look at how the present leadership is formed. They select their acquaintances, people with whom they studied, their former neighbours who they played soccer with, people they messed around with and continue messing around with.'

Business: Vladimir Putin (left) and oil tycoon Abramovich look through papers during a meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow

He accused the leaders of 'skimming off property and quietly sending money out of the country' while launching bogus battles against corruption.

'They are hiding everything in offshore structures,' he said.

And he said the leadership was too dominated by 'Chekists' - figures linked to the secret services.

'This is not normal. The domination of the special services, their ability to decide political matters, their active interference in the lives of citizens - this is unacceptable.'

He said the the decision on who would lead Russia after the 2012 presidential elections would be taken not by the people but two men - Putin and president Dmitry Medvedev.
'This is shameful,' he said.

'I am ashamed of them. They aren't acting humbly. As if we have no society, no constitution, no system of elections, and so on.

'The two of them will decide. The duumvirate. And what about the 140 million of us out here? '

He asked: 'Is this stability? Or just the preservation of personal power?'

And he warned: 'More and more there is a whiff of imitation in the country.'

He dismissed their claims to be 'the saviours' of Russia. 'I think we are far from that.'

Unless urgent reforms were made, Russia could end up with a revolution 'worse' than Egypt's, he predicted.",1
41,He flaunted private jets and luxury cars on Instagram. Feds used his posts to link him to alleged cyber crimes,"(CNN) Ramon Abbas flaunted a lavish lifestyle of private jets, designer clothes and luxury cars.

To his 2.5 million Instagram followers, he went by Ray Hushpuppi, a man who boarded helicopters from his Dubai waterfront apartment and walked around with shopping bags from Gucci, Versace and Fendi.

On social media, where he posted a video of himself tossing wads of cash like confetti, he told his followers he was a real estate developer. But a federal affidavit alleged his extravagant lifestyle was financed through hacking schemes that stole millions of dollars from major companies in the United States and Europe.

His flamboyant posts left a digital trail of evidence that investigators used to link him to the crimes, the affidavit shows.

Last month, United Arab Emirates investigators swooped into his Dubai apartment, arrested him and handed him over to FBI agents, who flew him to Chicago on July 2, federal officials said.

In the coming weeks, he'll be transferred to Los Angeles -- where the affidavit was filed -- to face accusations of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through cyber crime schemes.

$41 million and 13 luxury cars seized

The Nigerian national lived at the exclusive Palazzo Versace in Dubai, and led a global network that used computer intrusions, business email compromise schemes and money laundering to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from companies, federal prosecutors allege.

He worked with multiple co-conspirators and was arrested along with 11 others. Investigators seized nearly $41 million, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8 million, and phone and computer evidence, Dubai Police said in a statement. They uncovered email addresses of nearly 2 million possible victims on phones, computers and hard drives, Dubai authorities said.

""This case targets a key player in a large, transnational conspiracy who was living an opulent lifestyle in another country while allegedly providing safe havens for stolen money around the world,"" US Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement.

Abbas' attorney, Gal Pissetzky, declined to get into details on how his client earns his money. But what he does for a living is going to be ""one of the main points of contention here,"" he told CNN.

Pissetzky called his client's arrest a kidnapping, saying Dubai handed him to the United States with ""no legal proceedings whatsoever."" Abbas has not been formally indicted, and the government has 30 days to indict him, his attorney said Thursday.

His birthday post helped track him down

Abbas made no secret of his opulent lifestyle and remarkable wealth. On Snapchat, he called himself the ""Billionaire Gucci Master.""

""Started out my day having sushi down at Nobu in Monte Carlo, Monaco, then decided to book a helicopter to have ... facials at the Christian Dior spa in Paris then ended my day having champagne in Gucci,"" he posted on Instagram.

Photos of him displaying multiple models of Bentley, Ferrari, Mercedes and Rolls Royce cars included the hashtag #AllMine. Others show him rubbing elbows with international sports stars and other celebrities.

In the affidavit, federal officials detailed how his social media accounts provided a treasure trove of information to confirm his identity. His Instagram, for example, had an email and phone number saved for account security purposes. Federal officials got that information and linked that email and phone number to financial transactions and transfers with people the FBI believed were his co-conspirators.

""The email account ... also contained emails with attachments relating to wire transfers in large dollar values,"" the affidavit said.

His Apple and Snapchat records also provided information that helped investigators confirm his identity, address and communications with other suspects. Even his Instagram birthday celebration photos provided key information.

One post displayed a birthday cake topped with a Fendi logo and a miniature image of him surrounded by tiny shopping bags. Investigators used that post to verify his date of birth on a previous US visa application.

Companies targeted spanned two continents

His alleged cyber crimes involved jaw-dropping amounts of money.

Federal documents detailed how a paralegal at a New York law firm wired nearly $923,000 meant for a client's real estate refinancing to a bank account controlled by Abbas and his co-conspirators. The paralegal had received fraudulent wire instructions after sending an email to what appeared to be a bank email address but was later identified as a ""spoofed"" email address, the affidavit said.

Abbas sent a co-conspirator an image of the wire transfer confirmation for the transaction, according to the affidavit. He and an unnamed person also conspired to launder $14.7 million from a foreign financial institution last year, according to a criminal complaint.

During that alleged cyber crime, Abbas sent a co-conspirator the account information for a Romanian bank account, which he said could be used for ""large amounts."" In other alleged schemes, he also provided Dubai bank accounts that can be used to deposit money from victims in the United States, the affidavit said.

He's also accused of conspiring to try to steal $124 million from an unnamed English Premier League soccer club. But it's unclear whether the attempt was successful.

FBI recorded $1.7 billion in losses from such scams

Business email compromise schemes are sophisticated scams that involve a hacker redirecting business email account communications to try and intercept wire transfers.

""BEC schemes are one of the most difficult cyber crimes we encounter as they typically involve a coordinated group of con artists scattered around the world who have experience with computer hacking and exploiting the international financial system,"" Hanna said.

Last year alone, the FBI recorded $1.7 billion in losses by companies and individuals victimized through business email compromise scams, according to Paul Delacourt of the FBI field office in Los Angeles.

If convicted of money laundering, Abbas faces up to 20 years in prison. His bond hearing is set for Monday.

His transfer to Los Angeles has been complicated by logistics linked to coronavirus, his attorney said.",1

929,MUHAMMAD JAMAL ABD-AL RAHIM AHMAD AL-KASHIF,"Muhammad Jamal Abd-Al Rahim Ahmad Al-Kashif travelled to Afghanistan in the late 1980s where he trained with Al-Qaida to make bombs. On returning to Egypt in the 1990s, Muhammad Jamal became a top military commander and head of the operational wing of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) which was then, headed by current Al-Qaida leader Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006). Muhammad Jamal has been arrested multiple times by Egyptian authorities for EIJ-related terrorist activities and spent years in prison.

Muhammad Jamal formed the Muhammad Jamal Network (QDe.136) after his release from prison in 2011 and established multiple terrorist training camps in Egypt and Libya. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has provided funding to the Muhammad Jamal Network (MJN). Muhammad Jamal has used the AQAP network to smuggle fighters into MJN training camps. Suicide bombers are being trained at MJN training camps, and Muhammad Jamal has established links with violent extremists in Europe. Muhammad Jamal set up a training camp in Libya where Libyan and foreign violent extremists were trained. Some of the attackers of the U.S. Mission in Benghazi on 11 September 2012 have been identified as associates of Muhammad Jamal, and some of the Benghazi attackers reportedly trained at MJN camps in Libya.

Muhammad Jamal was most recently arrested by Egyptian authorities in November 2012. His confiscated computer contained letters to Al-Zawahiri in which Muhammad Jamal described MJN’s activities including acquiring weapons, conducting training, and establishing terrorist groups in the Sinai, and in which he asked Al-Zawahiri for assistance.

Before he was arrested in November 2012, Muhammad Jamal was the leader of the Nasr City Cell (the Cell), whose members have been accused of plotting terrorist attacks inside Egypt. Raids against the Cell in October 2012 recovered a large amount of weapons, explosives, and related material.

Muhammad Jamal is a former EIJ leader and is connected to other Al-Qaida senior leaders, including Aiman al-Zawahiri, and AQAP leadership including Nasir ‘abd-al-Karim ‘Abdullah al-Wahishi (deceased), and Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QDi.282). Jamal is also connected to The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014).",1
534,Wilbur Ross’s business partners say he stole $120 million,"If you don’t see corruption in American business, look a little closer at Wilbur Ross.

Four of Ross’s six former lieutenants are suing the commerce secretary for robbing them back when they worked together. Alongside improper fees and regulatory penalties, the questionable financial moves add up to a total $123 million, almost a fifth of Ross’ estimated $700 million in wealth.

The story comes to us from Forbes, which has been investigating Ross since the magazine discovered he lied to them about $2 billion in phony assets in order to assure a place on their list of billionaires. Digging into his record as a private equity investor, reporter Dan Alexander documented a boatload of dodgy moves.

None of this is the smash and grab of the bank robber, although Alexander reports that Ross is known to snatch up handfuls of free sweeteners at restaurants. (A spokesperson for Ross denied this.) Instead, this is larceny on a scale that only bankers can perform.

Ross ran a private equity firm called WL Ross & Co. that managed $4.1 billion for investors, which could make a fortune under standard fee structures—but Ross appears to have gone above and beyond.

The allegations against him fall into three buckets: First, the fund failed to make good on agreements to return $12 million in fees to investors. The SEC forced the company to repay that sum in 2016, and leveled a $3 million fine.

Second, Ross sold a controlling stake in his eponymous fund to a larger company called Invesco in 2006 for $100 million; afterward, Invesco had to pay $43 million in fines and reimbursements due to Ross’s pattern of charging inappropriate fees on failing investments and collecting money for serving on corporate boards in violation of his agreement with his investors.

Third, and perhaps most damning, six of Ross’ former colleagues, including the firm’s former co-chairman and Ross’ own deputy, have sued or are suing him for skimming some $56 million from their compensation. The former co-chairman reportedly received $10 million in a settlement in 2005, and another lawsuit settled confidentially last week.

In response to Forbes’ reporting, Ross said that SEC had never initiated a case against him personally and said the on-going lawsuits against him were “without merit.”

The opaque world of private equity investing often sees disputes over fees, but the pattern of allegations here suggests something out of the ordinary. Two lawsuits are winding their way through the court system and may shed more light on his behavior.

Ross is not unique among cabinet officials appointed by president Donald Trump when it comes to allegations of unethical behavior. Three members of his cabinet, Tom Price, Scott Pruitt, and David Shulkin, resigned amidst investigations into the abuse of their offices.

Trump himself has not divested from his companies, which appear to benefit from his official work, and has refused to release his tax returns publicly. His former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is currently on trial for financial crimes, and three of Trump’s former campaign advisers have pled guilty to crimes ranging from failure to disclose being a foreign agent to wire fraud.

When it comes to white-collar crime, it appears that America really may be swarming with Manaforts.",1

834,Key figure in £17 million investment scam jailed for siphoning away loot,"An investment conman is starting a prison sentence, six years after I warned about him.

Robert McKendrick finally came to grief after ignoring court orders by trying to hide his loot from
investigators.

I told in March 2013 how he was behind African Land, which was flogging investments in rice plantations in Sierra Leone with the slogan “We harvest – you profit”.

It offered juicy potential annual returns of 15%, but I told how you might be buying land that was over-priced and impossible to sell.

In fact, African Land sold more plots to investors than it owned – it had 3,000 acres but flogged 5,365.

Half of the money paid by investors disappeared into the pockets of Capital Alternatives Limited, which marketed the scheme, as commission.

In 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority stopped it from recruiting more investors and obtained a freezing order against McKendrick, who lives in posh Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

In 2015, African Land was put into compulsory liquidation in the High Court on the grounds that it was not regulated and so was operating illegally, a finding later confirmed by the Appeal Court.

In March last year, the High Court ordered that around £17 million should be repaid by leading figures in the schemes including 60-year-old McKendrick and accomplices Renwick Haddow and Marcia Hargous.

Haddow , 50, is currently in the United States where he's been charged in connection with separate investment scams that allegedly defrauded victims of £28million.

The UK courts made a further freezing order requiring McKendrick to disclose all his assets and barring him from disposing of them.

Now he’s been jailed for six months for contempt of court after trying to siphon away funds.

“Mr McKendrick misled investors and then, in contempt of court, failed to comply with court orders requiring him to properly account for the losses,” said Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority.

“The FCA will ensure that defendants who mislead investors are held to account to the fullest extent possible.”

The regulator revealed how sneaky McKendrick had diverted rental income from his portfolio of buy-to-let properties to his wife.

Mr Justice Marcus Smith noted in sentencing that he had admitted and apologised for the breaches but they were “many, varied and deliberate”.

McKendrick was the main director and sole shareholder of African Land, also known as Agri Capital.

He was also involved in a second unlawful Sierra Leone scheme called Reforestation Projects, aka Capital Carbon Credits.

Now that he has finally come clean about his assets, the FCA will try to recover as much as possible for investors.

Anyone who invested in African Land or Capital Carbon Credits needs to complete a questionnaire and send documents by 31 March 2019 – more information here: https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/capital-alternatives-information-investors

Investors in any of the four schemes who have not yet contacted the FCA should do so, even if they no longer have records of the investments.

621,Man gets 20 years for selling guns to terrorist group,"MIAMI -- A Colombian man who had been living in South Florida was sentenced Tuesday to 20 years in prison for selling firearms to a South American terrorist organization.

U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez sentenced Francisco Joseph Arcila Ramirez in Miami federal court, according to court records. Arcila pleaded guilty in October to providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

Arcila instructed two co-conspirators to illegally purchase six AK-style pistols in Miami-Dade County in August 2018, according to investigators. The firearms were then concealed in air-compressors purchased by Arcila at a Miami-area hardware store and shipped to Barranquilla, Colombia. The shipment also contained about 100 AK-47 magazines.

In September 2018, Arcila met in Colombia with a National Liberation Army weapons broker, according to prosecutors. Besides selling the six firearms for approximately 60 million Colombian pesos ($17,665), Arcila also discussed future sales with the violent paramilitary group.

The National Liberation Army was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department in 1997.",1
728,Vegas prosecutors say tech billionaire facing drug charges,"A billionaire California tech mogul who funds ""Marsy's Law"" crime victim rights campaigns nationwide was hit Wednesday with felony drug charges following his arrest last summer in a Las Vegas hotel suite with what police said were briefcases full of drugs.

Broadcom Corp. co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III and a woman who was with him, Ashley Christine Fargo, face five drug trafficking and two drug possession charges in a criminal complaint filed in state court in Las Vegas. Nicholas stepped down as president and CEO of the company in 2003.

The two have been free without bail pending charges since their arrests Aug. 7 at the Encore resort. They're due for arraignment March 11.

Nicholas' attorney, David Chesnoff, and Fargo's lawyer, David Brown, denied wrongdoing and said they'll fight the allegations.

""Dr. Nicholas is a philanthropist, an advocate for victims' rights, a scientist and co-founder of a global company,"" said Chesnoff, noting that Nicholas holds a doctorate in electrical engineering. ""He is not a drug trafficker.""

""Ms. Fargo is looking forward to correcting the sensational and erroneous information in some of the media coverage of this case,"" Brown said.

Police reported finding Fargo unconscious in a suite with methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, heroin, tablets believed to be ecstasy and mushrooms believed to contain hallucinogenic psilocybin.

The drug trafficking charges stemmed from the amount of controlled substances found, according to the complaint.

Nicholas identified a gas canister in the room as nitrous oxide ""for recreational use,"" according to a Las Vegas police arrest report, and Fargo was found with a deflated balloon in her mouth. The arresting officer suggested the balloon could have been used to inhale the gas.

Brown said Fargo was asleep, not unconscious, and woke after hotel security broke through the latched hotel room door.

Nicholas, 59, who uses the name ""Nick,"" lives in Newport Coast, California. He and a partner are credited with starting Broadcom in a Southern California garage in 1991. It is now a publicly traded Fortune 500 computer software, semiconductor and infrastructure company.

Fargo's attorney said she lives in Newport Beach.

In 2008, Nicholas was indicted in California on federal securities fraud and drug charges that were later dismissed.

That same year, he backed a California victim rights measure named for his sister, Marsalee ""Marsy"" Nicholas, who had been stalked and killed by an ex-boyfriend 25 years earlier.

Voters in Nevada passed a Marsy's Law initiative last year to expand the definition of a victim and list 16 rights including privacy, protection from a defendant, notice of court and parole hearings and ""full and timely restitution.""

Marsy's Law for All spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said 11 states now have similar laws. The organization issued a statement saying that Nicholas continues to lead the national organization that he funds.",1
635,Colombians Are Fed Up With Government Corruption,"By Fabio Andres Diaz

Civil unrest seems to be the order of the day – and the coming weeks – in Latin America. The sprawling Odebrecht bribery scandal that started in Brazil is now complicating life in many neighboring nations.

In Colombia, recent reports reveal that the Brazilian construction company has been bribing the country's public officials since 2010. With the 2018 presidential campaign heating up, the revelation is spurring dissatisfaction with President Juan Manuel Santos and imperiling the country's fledgling peace process.

On April 1, up to 16,000 Colombians took to the streets to decry corruption and express ongoing dissatisfaction with the peace accords signed with the FARC guerrillas. It was, in many ways, a march against the Colombian political establishment.

Public debate around the marches was largely redirected by mudslides in the city of Mocoa, the capital of the Putumayo province. They killed more than 300 citizens, including dozens of children, on the night of March 31.

The tragedy gave Santos, who is now entering the last year of his administration, the opportunity to reassert his leadership. And it briefly relieved the pressures that the Odebrecht corruption scandal was exerting on his government.

Colombia is not a regional outlier. Mass protests in 2016 famously contributed to the impeachment of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. And continuing public ire has helped spur the courts there to send numerous high-ranking government officials to jail for corruption. Argentina and Chile are also seeing citizens protest leaders from the political left, right and center.

In many cases, public outcry is linked to the massive number of government officials found to be in the pocket of Odebrecht, whose bribery network reaches from Colombia and Peru to Angola and Mozambique.

But in Colombia, the company is only part of a more complicated story behind recent protests.

Public malfeasance has long been common in the country. The 1994 presidential campaign of Ernesto Samper, for example, was found to have been funded by the Cali Cartel, then one of Colombia's most powerful trafficking organizations.

Even the main instigators of the April 1 march – former president Alvaro Uribe and former inspector general Alejandro Ordoñez – have themselves been found to be enmeshed in various corruption scandals. But that well-reported fact has not stopped them from actively mobilizing public opinion against corruption within the current government.

President Santos faces an unusual and contradictory political reality. Internationally, he is well regarded as a Nobel Peace Prize winner lauded for his efforts to end Colombia's armed conflict. But, at home, he is highly unpopular, with disapproval ratings of 71 percent.

This is due to an ironic twist of fate for the president. In signing the November 2016 peace accords with the FARC guerrillas, Santos took the formerly overwhelming question of armed conflict out of the spotlight and allowed corruption to take centre stage in the public mind.

Smear campaigns

Santos is a career politician, who served as minister of defense under his predecessor Alvaro Uribe, and is the grand nephew of a former president.

His detractors – led by Uribe, who is now among his most strident critics – are now using this experience to discredit him, calling him ""immoral"" and ""corrupt."" As evidence for their claims, they cite a formal investigation by Colombia's attorney general into whether the Odebrecht bribes played a role in Santos' 2014 presidential campaign.

The anti-Santos right-wing coalition includes the scandal-beset Ordoñez, as well as former minister of defense Marta Lucía Ramírez, and former vice president German Vargas Lleras. All of them fiercely opposed and nearly derailed the FARC accords in 2016. And all intend to run for the presidency in 2018.

This group does not have enough support to wield veto power in Congress. But by uniformly resisting any action undertaken by Santos and using smear campaigns to influence voter opinion, it has been successfully undermining the credibility of the current administration over the past two years.

The April 1 march is another tactic. In leveraging corruption concerns, the opposition seeks to position itself ahead of Santos's party in next year's presidential campaign.

Among other declared candidates, members of Uribe's faction will go up against Humberto de la Calle. He is a prominent figure from the Santos camp and was the government's lead negotiator in the FARC peace process. They will also stand against Bogota's leftist former mayor, Gustavo Petro, whom Ordoñez removed for administrative malfeasance.

The favorability rating of most of these would-be presidents has been falling recently, showing a general loss of legitimacy for Colombian political parties and their representatives.

In this twisted fashion, Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal, which is clearly no longer just confined to that country, brings to the fore the paradox of Latin America's burgeoning citizen engagement.

It is vital for democracy that people voice discontent with corruption, and Latin Americans' increasing intolerance for the bribery, embezzlement and deal-making that has long characterized institutions on the continent is good.

In many countries, the Odebrecht backlash has proven dramatic, increasing ire toward governments already under considerable pressure for unpopular measures, such as Brazil's budget cuts and Argentina's teacher strikes.

In Colombia, it is putting institutions to the test and shaping presidential politics. Corruption can no longer be cloaked under the veil of national security interests and blamed on the existence of an armed group like the FARC. The absence of a war rhetoric within Colombia obliges the government to be more accountable to citizens. That too is healthy.

But when popular outrage is manipulated by political operators who seek to advance their interests, democracy suffers. As in Brazil (where the main driver of Dilma Rousseff's impeachment, Eduardo Cunha, has now been jailed for corruption), politicians in Colombia tainted by other scandals are using Odebrecht as a Trojan horse to position their own political agendas.

It is a risky tactic in a nation that is still relatively fragile. If Colombia's institutions fail this challenge, the country could face a dramatic political transition, and a nation attempting to end war may find peace again endangered.",1
619,Billionaire Steve Wynn accused of sexual misconduct by dozens: Report,"— -- Real estate and casino mogul Steve Wynn, 76, has been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of people who shared similar accounts of his alleged pattern of abuse, The Wall Street Journal reported.

One of the women accusing Wynn is a former manicurist who worked at the Wynn Las Vegas shortly after it opened in 2005 and told several people that Wynn forced her to have sex after giving him a manicure, according to the WSJ.

After the woman gave Wynn a manicure, she said he told her to lie down on the massage table after pressuring her to take her clothes off, the WSJ reported. Wynn allegedly persisted after the woman told him she was married and didn't want to have sex.

The woman ultimately removed her clothing and the pair had sex, according to the WSJ. The woman's supervisor said she filed a detailed report recounting the episode to the casino's human resources department, and Wynn later paid the manicurist a $7.5 million settlement, the Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The incident was broadly referenced in a lawsuit in which Wynn's ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, sought to lift restrictions on the sale of her stock in Wynn Resorts Ltd., and Wynn's attorneys later admitted he made the personal payment in a court filing, according to report.

Wynn said in a statement that the idea that he ""ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.""

""We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits,"" Wynn said in the statement. ""It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.""

Wynn -- one of dozens of powerful men who have faced public allegations of sexual misconduct in recent months -- also said that the accusations stem from ""continued work"" by his ex-wife, whom he said he is involved in a ""terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement."" Wynn said he was ""repeatedly refused to capitulate to her demands.""

""Elaine has explicitly threatened to slander and destroy me, and I am surprised that the media is allowing itself to be used to advance this agenda,"" Wynn said. ""The conduct of Elaine during the course of the pending lawsuits has been shocking and deeply disturbing to me personally and as the CEO of Wynn Resorts.""

Wynn's attorneys declined to comment to the Wall Street Journal. ABC News has not been able to reach a representative for Wynn for comment.

In a statement, Wynn Resorts said that the allegations reported ""reflect allegations made in court hearings"" by Elaine Wynn, who is attempting to ""tarnish"" his reputation with a ""negative public relations campaign"" in an attempt to gain a revised divorce settlement.

""It is noteworthy that although Ms. Wynn says she knew about the 2005 allegations involving Mr. Wynn in 2009, she never made them known to the board of directors, of which she was then a member, and she did not raise them until after Mr. Wynn remarried and the shareholders of Wynn Resorts voted not to elect her to the board,"" according to the statement.

On Friday, Wynn Resorts' board of directors said it had formed a ""special committee of the board composed solely of independent members"" and chaired by Patricia Mulroy, a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission, to investigate the allegations.

""The Board is deeply committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all of the Company’s employees and to operating with the highest ethical standards,"" the board's statement said.

Devon Spurgeon, who represents Elaine Wynn, declined to provide a comment to ABC News in regard to the WSJ report and the lawsuit. An attorney for Elaine Wynn told the WSJ that the notion she instigated the report ""is just not true.""

Dozens of interviews conducted by the Journal with people who have worked at Wynn's casinos detailed a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct by Wynn, with some accusing him of pressuring employees to perform sex acts, the WSJ reported.

Former employees told the Journal that their awareness of Wynn's power in Las Vegas, as well as the knowledge that the positions at his resorts were among the best-paying in the city, caused them to feel dependent on him and intimidated when he made requests of them.

Jorgen Nielsen, the former artistic director of the salon at the Wynn Las Vegas, told ABC News that people would hide from Wynn.

""There was that fear when he walked in,"" Nielsen said. ""We would hide people. People would hide when he's requesting them to his room.""

Nielsen said he saw employees cry, get sick, have nervous breakdowns and lock themselves in bathrooms when Wynn requested them, while others would flat-out refuse. The salon had to resort to altering the books to show that people were not there when he requested them and would send employees to Wynn in pairs, he said.

""Sometimes we would call back for extra services, say, 'Oh, you need a haircut at the same time,'"" Nielsen said. ""That way, we could send two people.""

Nielsen said he resigned from the company four years ago because it was going in a different direction. He said that he was in charge of the salon ""when this was going on,"" and that if people said they didn't know what was going on, they have very bad memories.

A former massage therapist told the WSJ that several years ago, when Wynn was booking multiple appointments a week with her, he would continually expose himself in the private massage room in his office suite. At one session, he threw the towel off, saying, ""Just get this thing off of me.""

The masseuse said Wynn wouldn't let her use a towel to cover his genitals and that he began rubbing her leg as she massaged him. A few weeks later, he allegedly instructed her to massage his penis.

""Don't ignore it anymore,"" the massage therapist recalled him saying. Because he was her boss, the woman said she felt that she had no choice but to agree to some of Wynn's requests. Masturbating Wynn became a frequent part of their massage sessions for several months, and he would hand her $1,000 in cash after every session, the same amount as before the sexual requests began, according to The WSJ.

Wynn Resorts emphasized that it is ""committed to operating with the highest ethical standards and maintaining a safe and respectful culture that has made Wynn Resorts the employer of choice for 23,000 employees worldwide."" Wynn Resorts said it requires all employees to receive annual anti-harassment training and offers an independent hotline for employees to report harassment.

""Since the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that hotline regarding Mr. Wynn,"" according to the Wynn Resorts statement.

Wynn, chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts, has a net worth estimated at $3.5 billion, according to Forbes. He built Las Vegas's Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio, Wynn and Encore casinos, according to Forbes, although he only still owns the Wynn and Encore.

Wynn is currently building a $2.4 billion Wynn casino in the Boston area and also owns two Wynn casinos in Macau. He is a regular at his casinos and frequently has had services such as manicures, massages and makeup applications in his office at the Wynn Las Vegas, according to the Journal.",1
383,$15bn was 'not looted only mispriced' Chinamasa tells BBC HardTalk,"""Zanu-PF remains a very solid, cohesive formidable political force in Zimbabwe,"" Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa told Zeina Badawi on the BBC programme Hardtalk. Zanu-PF is imploding given the raging factional wars that have torn the party apart and the economic meltdown that has seen rioting and protest sweep the nation.

Zeina tried to corner the Minister on the failing economy, the disastrous land reform, corruption, etc. but failed at every turn. Programmes like Hardtalk only work when all parties accept hard facts; Minister Chinamasa's position was clear from start to finish if he could not blame anything on sanctions then deny it is true regardless of all the documented evidence. The Minister has come up with another explanation for the missing $15 billion from Marange diamonds.

""You are wrong to ascribe it (the looted $15 billion) to bad management,"" explained the Minis-ter. ""Over the years there has been an economic loss arising from trade mispricing. You put it differently, you say looting but I would rather put it as mispricing!""

The bottom line, as far as the Minister was concerned, was the ""mispricing"" was not deliberate and, most important of all, there was no hind of corruption and not even one fat cat benefited from it. This is the exact opposite of what many independent bodies like Africa Partnership Canada, Global Witness and even a number of Zanu-PF officials have been saying. Some of Minister Chinamasa's own Zanu-PF leaders have not only admitted there was a serious problem of looting in the diamond industry but went on to name some of the fat cats who have benefit-ed.

When Grace Mugabe launch her political bid to replace Mugabe as the next president in 2014 she set off by accused then VP Joice Mujuru of being corrupt and dealing in diamonds. Minister Kasukuwere and Minister Jonathan Moyo have since added the meat to the bone and accuse Mujuru of having looted ""a chunk"" of $15 billion worth of diamonds Robert Mugabe admitted was looted in his March 2016 interview on ZBC.

Of course it is not only Joice Mujuru who has been looting most, if not all, Zanu-PF leaders have all taken their share of the looted wealth be it in seized former white-owned farms, corrupt busi-ness dealings, looting diamonds, etc. Robert Mugabe himself has pocketed billions from Ma-range diamonds and has used some of the cash to fund the party's every elaborate and expen-sive vote rigging schemes.

The truth is mismanagement and corruption have been the milestones round the nation's neck that have dragged the national economy into this hell-hole and not the sanctions as Mugabe and his Ministers would have us.

Flying ""ruvunambwa"" (dog-killer) jackrabbit can junk and turn on a six-pence!

Watching Minister Chinamasa going through his well exercised routine of dodging questions and denying black is black on Hardtalk was like watching the junking jackrabbit nicknamed ""ruvhunambwa"" (dog-killer), it can turn on a six-pence to escape the snapping jaws of the dog. Ruvunambwa are known to run straight into a tree and junk the last step leaving an inexperience to plough straight into the tree and break its back hence the well-earned nickname!

As long as Zanu-PF remain in power; unless meaningful democratic reforms are implemented the regime will continue to rig elections and stay in power; no one will ever hold Mugabe and his cronies to account over anything because they will just deny everything. Mugabe has never held free and fair elections as one of his former Midlands Governor Cephas Msipa admitted recently. Zeina Badawi did not bother ask our ruvunambwa about rigged elections because he would certainly have denied that one. She asked him about Mugabe's refusal to name a successor which is causing all the political turmoil in Zanu-PF itself as factions fight for power.

""Each country has the right to travel its own path in history,"" responded Minister Chinamasa. ""And in the case of our President, yes he is 92, but you must also know the long path he has travelled almost since 1958. So he has definite views about the destiny of Zimbabwe and he remains in place to ensure that the trajectory he set for Zimbabwe remains even after he is gone.""

Mugabe's legacy is that he destroyed the country's once promising economy setting new world records of 500 billion per cent inflation rate, setting unemployment soaring to 80% plus and keeping it there for over decade, allowing $15 billion (that will turn out to be only the ears of the hippo) which is more that the nation $14 billion GDP to be looted, etc. On the political front, he has murdered over 30 000 Zimbabweans to establish and retain his de facto one-party cum one-man dictatorship. This is not the path the people want to follow!

One of these fine days when we finally have free, fair and credible elections and regime change; this Mugabe dictatorship is on its finally legs as demonstrated by the recent events of rioting and street protest sweeping the nation, the nation and the whole world will know the truth about Mugabe and this regime. The will know he is a corrupt and murderous tyrant who has systemat-ically brutalized the nation denying the people their freedoms and basic rights including the right to have a meaningful say in the governance of the country and even the right to life!

The winds of change are blowing in Zimbabwe and not even the most cunning and ruthless dictator like Mugabe and his cronies can stop the change whose time has come. The people of Zimbabwe have waited for 36 years for a free, just and prosperous Zimbabwe, they will not be denied the political change that is long overdue.

374,Five tax fraudsters ordered to pay £20m,"Michael Richards, and Jonathan Anwyl, both of East Sussex, Dubai-based Robert Gold, Rodney Whiston-Dew from London and Evdoros Chrysanthos Demetriou from Oxford, were all jailed for more than 43 years in 2017 for the £107.9m fraud, which was one of the UK’s biggest tax crimes.

At the Old Bailey in October and Southwark Crown Court in December, the five have now been ordered to pay a combined total of £20m or serve a further 39 years in prison.

Gold may need to sell a property in Dubai to settle his £2.6m bill, and Anwyl has cashed in his pension fund to meet his £250,000 order. Anwyl has paid his order and Gold has until late January 2020 to pay up or face an extra jail term of nine years.

Richards, who faces repaying £9.9m, and Whiston-Dew, who must find £3m, have properties in West Sussex and South-West London which they may need to sell to pay off their respective orders. Otherwise Richards will face a further 10 years in jail, and Whiston-Dew an additional nine years. Demetriou has the choice of paying over £4.6m or a further nine years in prison.

The sixth member of the crime group, Malcolm Gold, previously of Hertfordshire was sentenced to 20 months in prison in January 2017. He was subject to a confiscation order for £4,711, which was the amount of assets he had available at the time, and this order has been paid.

If further assets are identified in the future for any of the convicted men, they could also be confiscated.

The five men were convicted of tax crimes after HMRC investigators found they lured wealthy individuals to invest in carbon emission reduction certificates, which help countries hit environmental emissions targets set by the United Nations.

They created, marketed and administered a tax incentivised investment scheme which was intended to create a claim for sideways loss relief against income tax. The scheme was supposed to support re-forestation projects abroad, largely in Brazil, which would absorb carbon and so address climate change.

However, in reality the money was diverted to purchase properties in the UK and Dubai, none of which was declared to HMRC.

A ten-month long trial at Southwark Crown Court heard evidence that some 730 high net worth individuals invested large sums of money and claimed tax relief of over £107m in what the judge described as ‘a very effective fraud based on a very bad reforestation project’.

Martin Lynagh, assistant director, fraud investigation service, HMRC, said: ‘This was a carefully-planned and complex attack on the tax system and now the men have to pay up or spend even more time in prison, and still owe the money.

‘Our actions don’t stop once someone is convicted, we will look to reclaim the stolen money, cash that should be funding vital public services in the UK’.",1
257,Former Wirecard chief Markus Braun arrested,"Wirecard chief executive Markus Braun has been released on €5 million bail after his arrest in connection with a suspected fraud of nearly €2 billion at the Bavarian digital payments company.

Prosecutors in Munich confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Braun was arrested on suspicion of using fake transactions to inflate his company’s balance sheet, possibly with others, to make the company he has headed since 2002 more attractive to customers and investors.

Last week auditors EY refused to sign off on the company accounts until the €1.9 billion – around a quarter of the company’s assets – could be located. On Monday, Wirecard, which operates digital payments between retailers and customers, admitted that the missing assets never existed.

“In an initial conversation, he promised his co-operation,” said Anne Leiding, a spokeswoman for Munich investigators, promising an “open-ended investigation”.

Among the charges investigators are considering filing are “incorrect information” in the Wirecard balance sheet, as well as market manipulation and fraud.

The arrest of Mr Braun, once a darling of the local fintech scene before his resignation last Friday, has electrified managers and media alike in Germany. Ongoing confusion over Wirecard’s actual financial position – how much is real and how much illusion – has raised questions about the efficacy of BaFin, the German financial regulator.

Fears are growing that further Wirecard revelations could compound Germany’s gloomy economic outlook: on Tuesday, leading economists forecast that Europe’s largest economy will shrink by 6.5 per cent this year – a post-war record.

Meanwhile, leading German traders that use Wirecard – discount retailer Aldi, Germany’s big three mobile operators and Sky Deutschland – are said to be reviewing their contracts with the firm. Some are demanding daily transfer of transaction totals to reduce their exposure in the case of a possible collapse.

Irish presence

Wirecard was founded in 1999 and employs almost 6,000 people in 26 countries, including in Ireland. Mr Braun, its Austrian-born chief executive since 2002 as well as chief technology officer, holds 7 per cent of the company stock and is the largest shareholder.

Wirecard’s managers are locked in negotiations with banks and other creditors to avoid a collapse of the company after a search for missing money ended in the Philippines. When that country’s central bank denied the €1.9 billion had entered the country’s financial system, Wirecard shares crashed 85 per cent on Monday.

The fraud investigation has rattled German politicians. Federal finance minister Olaf Scholz has described the scandal as “extremely worrying” and said it raises “critical questions” over management and oversight.

“Auditors and supervisory bodies do not seem to have been effective here,” said Mr Scholz.

Germany’s financial regulator Felix Hufeld described the Wirecard scandal as a “disgrace” for Germany. “We are in the middle of the most outrageous situation in which I have ever seen a Dax firm,” he said, admitting his own body had failed to do its job with the payments company.

Opposition politicians in Berlin have demanded that heads roll in BaFin for its ineffective supervision of Wirecard.",1
44,José Rodrigo Aréchiga Gamboa,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to navigation Jump to search

(15 June 1980 – 15 May 2020), commonly referred to by his alias ""El Chino Ántrax"", was a Mexican suspected drug lord, professional hitman, and high-ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal organization based in Sinaloa.

He was one of the leaders and the founder of Los Ántrax, an armed squadron that protects Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a top cartel leader. He was arrested on December 30, 2013 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands at the request of the United States, which contacted Interpol to arrest him for charges relating to drug trafficking. He was extradited to the US on 10 July 2014. After being sentenced to house arrest, on 9 May 2020, he was reported missing along with all of his belongings. He soon returned to Culiacan, Sinaloa where he was killed alongside his sister, and brother-in-law on 15 May 2020.

Early life[ edit ]

José Rodrigo Aréchiga Gamboa, often referred to by his alias 'El Chino Ántrax', was born in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico on 15 June 1980. [1] [2] [3] Aréchiga Gamboa began to work for the Sinaloa Cartel as a bodyguard of Vicente Zambada Niebla (alias ""El Vicentillo""), son of Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, until 2008. Following the separation of the Sinaloa organization and the Beltrán Leyva Cartel that year, he went on to form Los Ántrax, an armed squadron of the Sinaloa Cartel for providing armed security services to ""El Mayo"" Zambada. [4] [5] [6]

He was nearly killed on 4 November 2008 when an armed commando opened fire at a car wash in Culiacán. In the attack, Los Ántrax lost one of its members, Alfredo Vizcarra Vega (alias ""El Fello Ántrax""), son of a Sinaloa police commander. Aréchiga Gamboa reportedly managed to escape uninjured during the shootout. Following the arrest of Zambada Niebla in March 2009, the drug lord ascended in the apex of the Sinaloa Cartel given his friendship with one of ""El Mayo"" Zambada's sons. He was then called to oversee the plaza (turf) of Culiacán, the center of operations of Los Ántrax and the city where the Zambada family reportedly resided. [7]

Tenure in Los Ántrax[ edit ]

In 2008, he founded Los Ántrax with another drug lord known as René Velázquez Valenzuela (alias Sergeant "" Phoenix Ántrax"",Vladi portillo [the Russian] ""El Gato Negro"" [8] (Black cat) and ""El Taliban"" [9]), who was arrested by the Mexican Army that year and sent to jail in Aguaruto, Sinaloa. Among the first gang leaders to die was Redel Castro (alias ""El Pocho Ántrax""), who was killed in a massive shootout in June 2010 with rival members of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel in Tubutama, Sonora. [7] In May 2011, the Mexican Army arrested, tortured, and killed three members of Los Ántrax after they mistook them for kidnappers: the members were Franklin Olguín Velázquez (alias ""El Franki"" and/or ""El Dos""), Jesús Humberto Corona Guillén (alias ""El Chuve""), and Pedro Valenzuela Meza (alias ""El Pedrón""). [10] In November of that year, Francisco Arce Rubio (alias ""Pancho Arce""), another high-ranking gang leader close to El Chino Ántrax, was killed during an indoor soccer game in Culiacán by rival gangsters of Los Mazatlecos. [11] Following the death of Arce Rubio, ""El Mayo"" Zambada withdrew El Chino Ántrax from the day-to-day activities of Los Ántrax until he sorted things out. However, the attacks against the gang continued; in February 2012, Roque Landeros (alias ""Roque Ántrax"") was killed with three other men in Culiacán. [7] [12] Local media outlets alleged that the killings stemmed from an internal power struggle within the Sinaloa Cartel, specifically from a group commanded by ""El Chapo"" Guzmán. [13] Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) and Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) have identified various other leaders under the hierarchy of El Chino Ántrax. Jesús Peña (alias ""El 20"") is believed to be a close associate of the drug lord; [5] [7] others include a man known as Melesio (alias ""El Mele""); ""El Traka Ántrax"", identified by authorities as the gang's recruiter; Eusebio Imperial or Eliseo Castro (alias ""El Cheyo Ántrax""), a supposed nephew of ""El Mayo"" Zambada; [7] [14] a man known as ""El Monkey""; and ""El Changuito"", the former alleged financial head of Los Ántrax, both arrested on 16 April 2012. [7] [13]

Aréchiga Gamboa was wanted by the United States government and faced charges in a San Diego, California federal court for trafficking methamphetamines, cocaine and marijuana. [15] [16] The charge alleged that he conspired with other people to import 500 grams of methamphetamines and 5 kilograms of cocaine to the U.S. [17] The indictment, started by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in late 2011, was part of an investigation known as Operation Narco Polo, where federal agents intercepted several phone calls from March and October 2012 between Aréchiga Gamboa and drug traffickers from the San Diego–Tijuana area. The investigation also included the testimony of arrested smugglers, seized drugs and money, and photographs that inculpate them. [18] [19]

From 2011 and 2013, the drug lord lived in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur and led Los Ántrax against the criminal group Los Zetas in the area. [20] While in Los Cabos, Aréchiga Gamboa reportedly ordered the murder of Francisco Rafael Arellano Félix, a former leader of the Tijuana Cartel, on 18 October 2013. The PGR revealed that the motive possibly stemmed from Arellano Félix's involvement in money laundering activities and as a message from the Los Ántrax to show that they were in charge of organized crime in Los Cabos. The Baja California state authorities identified the possible murders of the drug lord: Noé Castro (alias ""R1""), Aréchiga Gamboa's right-hand man in Los Cabos; and a man known by his alias ""R13"". [21]

Social media activities[ edit ]

His most common alias is Chino Anthrax, but the drug lord is also known as El Comandante Ántrax (""Commander Anthrax""), R-57, El Oriental (""The Oriental""), El Quinto Elemento (""The Fifth Element""), Scarface Renacido (""Reborn Scarface""), among others. [17] On his Facebook, Twitter (@comandante57_) and Instagram (miauuuu5_7 and jamesbond5_7) accounts, Aréchiga Gamboa uploaded pictures and videos of his ostentatious lifestyle, which included trips to Europe, Las Vegas (where he attended the Manny Pacquiao vs. Brandon Rios fight), Japan, and parts of Africa and the Middle East. In one of his pictures, the drug lord appears alongside Paris Hilton. [22] [23] The drug lord also has pictures with Ismael Zambada Imperial (alias ""El Mayito Gordo""), son of ""El Mayo"" Zambada and a high-ranking enforcer within the cartel. [24] He also has pictures with Serafín Zambada Ortiz (alias ""El Sera""), also son of ""El Mayo"" Zambada who was arrested by U.S. authorities in November 2013 while attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. [14]

He also uploaded pictures of his sport cars, yachts, weapons, jewelry, money, and extravagant parties with famous narcocorrido bands. [23] On social media, he raffled cellphones, sunglasses, cars, and other gifts with his followers. [22] [7] He frequently appeared on his Instagram feed sporting his muscular physique, protein intakes, and workout routines. [25] Aréchiga Gamboa also has several narcocorrido ballads about him, some which describe him as an ""elegant and fit man"" who enjoys his sport cars, yachts, and drinking champagne. [17] [26] He was part of the younger generation of Mexican drug traffickers that enjoy displaying their luxurious lifestyle online. [27] [28] Although he always blurred his face in his social media pictures, in most of them he was shown wearing the skull shaped diamond ring, in reference to Los Ántrax, as a form of signature. [29] [30] Despite attempting to be discreet by blurring his face, U.S. authorities were able to track him down thanks to his photos. They learned that Aréchiga Gamboa liked to travel across the world; his ring also helped them identify him when he landed in the Netherlands from Mexico on 31 December 2013 and was arrested. [31]

On 3 January 2014, the Netherlands Ministry of Security and Justice and the Mexican Embassy in the country confirmed that a 33-year-old Mexican citizen had been arrested by the Dutch police as he arrived from Latin America to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands using a false name on 30 December 2013. [32] [A 1] Initially, the authorities did not give any details on the identity of the detainee, but an anonymous U.S. federal agent and Mexican local newspapers leaked information to the media that the man was in fact Aréchiga Gamboa. [34] [36] The arrest of the drug lord was officially confirmed later that day by the U.S. government. [26] According to officials, Aréchiga Gamboa travelled with the fake name of Norberto Sicairos García; at the time of his arrest, he was carrying an iPhone 5, a Blackberry Bold, three airplane tickets, credit cards from Visa and MasterCard from Banamex, and a Mexican driver's license. Upon his arrest, he was sent to the Vught maximum-security prison. [37] U.S. law enforcement managed to identify Aréchiga Gamboa through unspecified forensic methods despite the fact that the drug lord had used a fake name to travel, undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, and altered his finger prints. [38]

On 2 January 2014, he appeared before a judge, who spoke about his situation and the motives behind his arrest. [7] The Dutch authorities confirmed that the drug lord had been arrested at the request of the U.S. government, which had contacted Interpol to assist them in the arrest of the drug lord for charges relating to drug trafficking. [39] [40] They did not contact Mexican officials. [19] The following day, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California solicited an extradition request to bring the drug lord to trial in the U.S. [41]

Kingpin Act sanction[ edit ]

On 8 January 2014, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned the drug lord under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), which froze assets he may have had in the U.S. and virtually prohibited U.S. citizens from carrying out financial or commercial deals with him. The document alleged that, besides working for the drug lord ""El Mayo"" Zambada, Aréchiga Gamboa coordinated logistics and drug transportations for ""El Chapo"" Guzmán and worked alongside Gonzalo Inzunza Inzunza (alias ""El Macho Prieto""), another Sinaloa Cartel high-ranking enforcer who was killed in Sonora in December 2013. The drug lords he worked for had already been sanctioned by the U.S. government under the Kingpin Act in 2001, 2002, 2009, and 2011. [42]

Extradition and trial[ edit ]

On 14 May 2014, an official spokesperson of a court in Haarlem stated to the press that the request of the U.S. to extradite Aréchiga Gamboa was planned to be defined by 29 May 2014. [43] On 28 May 2014, a Dutch court approved the extradition to the U.S. The defense of El Chino Ántrax, who was not present during the hearing, was allowed by law to appeal the decision, a process that could have taken months. [44] On 10 July 2014, he was extradited from Amsterdam to the U.S., where he arrived at the San Diego International Airport at around 2:00 p.m. under tight security by the DEA and the U.S. Marshal Service. Upon his arrival, he was taken into custody and booked for his drug-related charges. He was expected to be arraigned on such charges the next day. [45]

The following day, he pleaded not guilty to the drug charges against him and was held without bail after the U.S. Magistrate Mitchell D. Dembin deemed him a public threat and capable of fleeing to Mexico if released. Those present in the courtroom had to pass a secondary metal detector and pat-down before entering the hearing site. According to one of the case's attorneys, a group of women who were supposedly family members of Aréchiga Gamboa sat in one of the middle rows of the courtroom. They declined to comment about the case, just like Aréchiga Gamboa's defense Frank Ragen. [46] [47] After his court appearance, Aréchiga Gamboa was imprisoned at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, San Diego and was scheduled to appear in court again for a motion hearing conducted by federal judge Dana Makoto Sabraw on 22 August 2014. [48] [47]

On the morning of 21 August 2014, he reappeared in court for a twenty-minute hearing. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California declared it a ""complex case"" after the defense asked for a time extension given the overwhelming amount of evidences presented by the prosecution. According to the court archives, the DEA has under its possession documents that prove that Aréchiga Gamboa participated in at least fifty drug trafficking shipments between Mexico and the United States. His next court appearance was scheduled for 21 November 2014. [49] [50] On that date, however, the hearing was postponed to 6 March 2015 after his attorney asked in court for more time to evaluate the evidence against his client. Unlike in other court sessions, Aréchiga Gamboa's family members were not present in the courtroom. [51]

He pleaded guilty on 20 March 2015 and admitted that he had participated in cocaine and marijuana shipments from Mexico to the U.S., and that he had facilitated violent activities for the Sinaloa Cartel. [52] [53]

After being in custody in the United States for six years, Archeiga was sentenced to seven years and three months in US federal prison. [54]

On March 3, 2020, he was released and placed into house arrest. On May 9, his probation office reported him as missing. [55]

Death[ edit ]

On the night of May 15, he was kidnapped in Sinaloa, Mexico, by unknown armed men along with his sister and brother in law. The next day police in the town of Ayune, Sinaloa, discovered a black SUV with what appeared to be 3 dead bodies inside, one of the bodies was later identified as José Rodrigo Aréchiga Gamboa, he was shot dead and wrapped in a cloth, his head was covered with a black plastic bag. The other 2 bodies belonged to his sister and brother in law. It was later reported that his murder was not the result of retaliation from a rival cartel and was likely carried out by senior leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. [56]

Family[ edit ]

His romantic partner Yuriana Castillo Torres was reportedly kidnapped by armed men while heading to her vehicle after leaving a gym in Culiacán, Sinaloa on 6 May 2014 [57] Her corpse was discovered on 06:45 the next day by Mexican law enforcement at a vacant lot in Lomas de Guadalupe neighborhood in Culiacán, and confirmed to be hers by her family members at the forensic installations. [58] Post-mortem reports showed that Castillo Torres had been tortured, received several blows to the head, and that her hands and legs were tied with an electric cable. [59] At the funeral home where the wake took place, members of Los Ántrax reportedly paid their condolences by leaving a floral ornament in honor of her. [60]

There are several narcocorridos (drug ballads) that narrate some of the exploits of Aréchiga Gamboa and his assassin squad Los Ántrax. Most of the songs belong to the trend of narcocorridos known as movimiento alterado (""the altered movement""), which promotes violence in reference to the physiological effect of cocaine consumption. [61] [62]

17,Zimbabwe arrests vice president’s wife over fraud allegations,"Zimbabwean authorities have arrested the wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga on charges of money laundering, fraud and violating exchange control regulations, the country’s anti-corruption body has said.

Marry Mubaiwa, 38, was arrested on Saturday evening and will likely appear in court on Monday, Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) spokesman John Makamure said on Sunday. He declined to give further details.

Mubaiwa made no immediate comment.

Appointed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa this year, ZACC is under pressure to show that it can tackle high-level corruption, which watchdog Transparency International estimates is costing the country $1bn annually.

An internal ZACC memorandum of the charges seen by Reuters news agency showed that between October 2018 and May 2019 Mubaiwa is accused of unlawfully transferring $919,000 to South Africa under the guise of importing goods, which it claims she never did.

The timing of Mubaiwa’s arrest will likely raise eyebrows after local private media reported two weeks ago that she was going through a divorce with her husband Chiwenga.

The ZACC memo accused Mubaiwa of fraudulently obtaining a marriage certificate without Chiwenga’s consent earlier this year when the vice president was ill. The two have been married under Zimbabwe’s customary law since 2011 and have two children.

Chiwenga returned home last month after spending four months in China receiving medical treatment for a blocked oesophagus. He has not been seen with Chiwenga in public, including at the annual governing party conference that ended on Saturday.

Critics of ZACC say the agency is conflicted because its head judge, Loice Matanda-Moyo, is the wife of Zimbabwe’s Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo, a top ally of President Mnangagwa.",1
475,ROBERT MERCER — MONEY LAUNDERER FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN,"Renaissance Technologies (RENTEC) is the second largest hedge fund in the US, managing $45 billion in assets. It has a reputation for being the most successful hedge fund in history, for using quantitative trading strategies designed by top scientists, and for being extremely secretive.

Publicly available information on RENTEC implies that the firm is a massive money laundering tool disguised as a hedge fund, operating on behalf of Vladimir PUTIN.

BACKGROUND
Money laundering involves a transaction where illicit money is spent by one party, producing a seemingly legitimate profit for another party. Ostensibly the two parties are unrelated, but in reality, both parties are closely connected.

The money laundering process can be summarized in three steps:
• SOURCE Secure illegally sourced funds.
• TRANSACT Illegal money is used in a transaction, resulting in profits for another party.
• COVER UP The true nature of the transaction is visible only to insiders.

Evidence suggests money laundering via financial markets works like this:
• SOURCE Criminal organization invests in a hedge fund (Fund A) operating in a market with a high degree of corruption (for example Russia).
• TRANSACT On behalf of Fund A, an international bank purchases a security in the corrupted market. The bank then sells(i.e. shorts) the same security in a second developed market (for example the UK), and forwards the proceeds to Fund B. Both funds are owned by the same criminal organization.
• COVER UP The nature of the transactions are obfuscated with advanced financial techniques and the inner workings of the fund are kept secret.

A significant degree of sophistication is required to launder money in plain sight via financial markets. Due to this sophistication, it’s unlikely direct evidence will come to light without access to internal records. However, by using other cases as a guide, the following mosaic of indirect evidence will likely be found:
• SOURCE Key people are connected to criminal organizations via one or more intermediaries.
• TRANSACT An abnormally high rate of return that allows significant amounts of money to be laundered in a short amount of time. Evidence of buying and selling the same securities in different markets.
• COVER UP History of using financial engineering to hide the nature of transactions and a reputation for extreme secrecy.

SOURCE
Russia is controlled by a vast organization comprised of the intelligence services, organized crime and big business. This organization is led by Vladimir PUTIN and control is maintained through corruption, blackmail and assassination. (1)

Because of the high degree of control PUTIN has over Russian centers of power, all Russians in positions of influence should be assumed to have at least PUTIN’s blessing. Any persons significantly connected with these Russians are likely contributing to PUTIN’s goals either witting or otherwise.

Robert MERCER is co-CEO of RENTEC. MERCER is the largest financial backer of Donald TRUMP’s presidential campaign, and an influential funder of Republicans and conservatives causes including Citizens United. (2)

MERCER invested in data science firm CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. MERCER insisted TRUMP campaign hire CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA to design its social media strategy. Through CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA and its owner Vincent TCHENGUIZ, MERCER is connected to PUTIN protégé Dmitry FIRTASH and Russian Intelligence Services (RIS). (3, 4)

March 2017 MERCER’s yacht the ‘Sea Owl’ was spotted in the British Virgin Islands, anchored next to Dmitry RYBOLOVLEV’s yacht the ‘Anna.’ RYBOLOVLEV is a member of PUTIN’s inner circle and likely his personal courier. (5)

MERCER is part owner of BREITBART news. The FBI is investigating BREITBART and CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA for cooperating with RIS during the 2016 US election. Evidence suggests that CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA and BREITBART used information warfare techniques in cooperation with RIS to support TRUMP and attack Hillary CLINTON. (3, 6, 7)

Several of RENTEC’S Russian born employees have been in the news:
• In the late 1990s Alexey KONONENKO was given a prominent role within RENTEC’s equities group. His rapid promotion was questioned by colleagues and characterized as a “power play.” (8)
• In 2001 RENTEC sued two Russian employees Alexander BELOPOLSKY & Pavel VOLFBEYN for intellectual property theft after they left for rival fund Millennium Partners. (8)
• In 2006 Alexander ASTASHKEVICH shot and killed his wife and himself. (9)

Prior to starting RENTEC in 1982, the firm’s founder Jim SIMONS was a cryptologist, contracted to the NSA. Like Edward SNOWDEN, SIMONS would have been a valued target for recruitment by RIS. (10)

2014 RENTEC received media attention for increasing its holding in Russian telecom company VIMPLECOM. Newsworthy because the stock was dropping following Russia’s annexation of Crimea. In 2016 RENTEC further increased its holding in VIMPLECOM by 438%. VIMPLECOM is controlled by PUTIN insider Mikhail FRIDMAN. (11)

TRANSACT
In the past 20 years the average hedge fund returned 9% per year. In the same period RENTEC’s “MEDALLION” fund averaged 40%. After twenty years, one-thousand dollars invested in the average hedge fund would be worth nearly six-thousand dollars, the same investment made in MEDALLION would be worth over eight hundred-thousand dollars. (22)

RENTEC has long claimed that it must limit the size of its MEDALLION fund (most recently at $10 billion) in order to preserve its high rates of return. So, it was newsworthy when shortly after the election of Donald TRUMP the firm announced that it would be increasing the fund’s size by fifty percent and that employees would only have several weeks to raise additional funds. This would increase the fund to $15 billion and at current rates of return would produce a profit of $6 billion in 2017. In normal years virtually all profits of the fund are returned to investors instead of being re-invested. This unusual degree of cash returned to investors could be used to facilitate money laundering. (22)

Hedge funds are normally secretive in order to prevent competitors from copying their investment strategies. However, RENTEC is not only secretive about its strategies, but also about its financial position and executive compensation. For this reason, very little is known about internal workings of the firm. What can be pieced together is RENTEC uses quantitative models to buy and sell millions of stocks a year based on statistical ARBITRAGE strategies. Statistical ARBITRAGE attempts to make money by buying one security and selling another. These securities could be similar stocks in the same industry, or the same security trading in different markets.

COVER UP
In 2017 DEUTSCHE BANK was fined $425 million by the US government for laundering $10 billion out of RUSSIA using a scheme known as MIRROR TRADES. The scheme involved a customer in Moscow ordering DEUTSCHE BANK to buy shares for Rubles and then to immediately sell an identical amount of the same shares in London for Dollars. (14)

The money used in the scheme belonged to Igor Putin (cousin of Vladimir PUTIN) and the ROTENBERG brothers who are old friends of PUTIN. Investigators speculated that MIRROR TRADES where a part of a much larger money laundering operation but to date no additional evidence has been made public. To outsiders MIRROR TRADES are nearly indistinguishable from ARBITRAGE. (14)

MIRROR TRADES were kept under the radar by trading “over the counter”, and through a remote booking feature that did not require direct participation of the London office. Records showing losses at the end of the trading day would mysteriously show zero losses at the beginning of the next day. This strongly indicates traders were JOURNALING assets (moving assets between accounts) in order to make up for losses in one account with gains from another. (14, 15)

RENTEC is currently under investigation by the IRS for using a similar financial engineering structure to MIRROR TRADES known as BASKET OPTIONS (an option containing many different securities). Congressional investigators have claimed BASKET OPTIONS were used to avoid taxes and limitations on leverage, but they could also be used to facilitate money laundering. On behalf of the MEDALLION fund, RENTEC purchased an option from DEUTSCHE BANK and then sold the option one year later and claimed the long-term tax rate (24%) applied. In reality RENTEC exercised full control of the contents of the option, and executed hundreds of millions of high frequency transactions a year, most lasting only milliseconds. (16, 17)

If the IRS finds that RENTEC should be charged the short-term tax rate (44%), the fund will owe $6.8 billion. 2017 McClatchy reported on the investigation and specifically linked the possible tax bill with the increasing investments in political candidates made by RENTEC executives. Two weeks after the report was published the author Scott CHRISTIANSON died from massive head trauma at his home. (16, 18)

Evidence presented to US Congressional committee investigating RENTEC show that DEUTSCHE BANK allowed RENTEC to JOURNAL assets between sub accounts, thereby avoiding market transactions of buying and repurchasing the same security that could be interpreted as manipulative trading. Other evidence included emails from William BROEKSMIT, the DEUTSCHE BANK employee charged with managing the BASKET OPTIONS for RENTEC where he went into detail how the scheme was executed. In 2014 BROEKSMIT was found dead in his London apartment as result of hanging. (16, 19)

RENTEC is also currently under investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. RENTEC has resisted calls from the agency to hand over source code that runs MEDALLION’s trading algorithms. (20)

RENTEC manages three separate funds, two of these funds are available to outside investors. The third fund is the highly secretive MEDALLION and only accepts money from RENTEC employees. Records show that only five executives own seventy percent of the fund. In 2009, investors in the public funds were unhappy that MEDALLION’s returns far exceeded returns of their investments. These complaints led to an SEC investigation. SIMONS took the blame and resigned, making MERCER co-CEO together with IBM colleague and former roommate Peter BROWN. (21, 23)

CONCLUSION
The preceding sections demonstrate RENTEC has connections with Russian elites, produces extremely high rates of return via ARBITRAGE transactions, and engages in financial engineering techniques that are functionally equivalent to known money laundering methods. These are all red flags that imply RENTEC is involved in money laundering on behalf of Vladimir PUTIN.

The evidence suggests that RENTEC is a massive Russian money laundering operation hiding under the guise of a highly successful hedge fund. The scheme functions similar to MIRROR TRADES where shares are purchased in Moscow, immediately sold by RENTEC in the US, recorded as RENTEC’s profit, and the shares JOURNALED between US and Moscow accounts by DEUTSCHE BANK. RENTEC hides this scheme by executing hundreds of millions of trades a year, by using BASKET OPTIONS, and by limiting investment of the fund to RENTEC insiders. Every year RENTEC is capable of washing funds equal to the annual profits of its MEDALLION fund which are estimated at $6 billion this year.

For this scheme to be successful, all senior RENTEC leadership would have been involved including MERCER and SIMONS. In the 2016 election cycle MERCER spent $15 million on Republican candidates with the majority going towards supporting Donald TRUMP. In the same year SIMONS also spent $15 million, but on Democratic candidates, much of it going towards Hillary CLINTON. Regardless of the election result, PUTIN was guaranteed to have an agent with significant influence on the President of the United States.

33,Suspicious transaction,"Kazi Zahidul Hasan :
Bangladesh Bank (BB) has sought accounts information of at least 150 foreign nationals and several overseas organisations from the banks up to November this year to look into their 'suspicious' transaction within the country's financial system, sources said.
They said, among the foreign nationals and entities, a number of individuals and four business houses are linked with the Brothers' Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate.
Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU), an anti-money laundering arm of the central bank, recently asked for such information from the banks following requests from Egmont Group's member countries.
BFIU is one of the members of 140 Egmont Group countries.
According to the US Department of Treasury, Brothers' Circle is a transnational crime syndicate composed with leaders and senior members of Eurasian criminal groups. It is largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is also operating in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Since it is running businesses in various countries, it developed 'illicit' financial networks across the world for providing revenues and support to their global criminal activities.
Admitting the matter, Mahfuzur Rahman, spokesperson and BB Executive Director told The New Nation yesterday that bank account details of the foreign nationals and entities were sought from the banks following the request from the FIUs of the respective countries.
""The FIUs of the Egmont Group member countries have treaties to share information on the bank accounts held by their citizens within the member countries,"" he added.
He further said as part of the deals, we asked for information about the citizens' bank accounts to be held in local banks to investigate whether they are involved in illicit money transaction.
""We later exchange information of bank transactions of the suspected persons and business entities in compliance with the deals to combat money laundering and terror financing,"" he noted.
When asked, he declined to disclose the information regarding suspicious transaction, and money laundering by the suspected foreigners and overseas businesses.
He, however, said that the officials of BFIU remain determined to continue their efforts to detect illegal fund transfer in and outside the country in order to protect the country's financial system from the individuals as well as criminal groups.
The BFIU asked for bank details of 42 people from different countries in January this year. Of them, 26 were believed to be involved in suspicious transaction and the rest them were their family members.
On similar requests, it sought bank transaction information of 33 Ukrainians on April 3 this year and 21 Argentineans on April 10. It also sought account information of several citizens of India, Bahrain, the Philippines, Japan and the United Kingdom.
Details of transactions by Ahmed Shahin, Belal Hossain and Ferdous Ahmed, three Bangladeshi nationals living in South Africa, were sought on August 18.
In a letter sent to the banks on November 10, the central bank investigators sought account details of Isam Yusuf Zahani, Imad Omar Allesnas and Omaima Othman Al-Mahmud, three Bahraini citizens, stating their birthplaces and passport numbers.
Another letter, on November 5, it asked for information on Japanese citizen Shinichi Mitate, also attaching his birth and passport details.
Among the suspected individuals of Brothers' Circle, BB has also asked the banks to provide information about its key members Vladislav Leontyev (Russian), Gafur Rakhimov (Uzbek), Artur Badalyan (UAE), Vadim Mikhaylovich Lyalin (Russia), Grigory Victorovich Lepsveridze (Russia), Igor Leonidovich Shlykov (Russia), Surgey Yevgeniyevich Moskalenko (Uzbek) and Yakov Rybalsky (Israel).
Earlier, the US authorities had sent a letter to BB requesting bank information of the key members of the criminal gang.
It also identified the gang as a threat to 'national and international' security and asked for confiscating all its assets and property.
Vladislav Leontyev has been involved in various criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking while Gafur Rakhimov, one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime group, operating major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin.
Igor Leonidovich Shlykov owns or controls M S Group Invest Company and Meridian Jet Management based in Russia and Austria respectively.
Gurgen House Company Ltd is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian, who is working on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House has offices in the UAE, Uzbekistan and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House to move money.
Artur Badalyan owns Fasten Tourism LLC based in Dubai, UAE.
BFIU of BB also asked account details of the foreign business houses from banks in a letter in June this year.
When asked, whether the Brothers' Circle is operating in the country, a senior official of an intelligent agency said, they have no information regarding their operation in Bangladesh.",1
222,Mapping Corruption: Donald Trump’s Executive Branch,"THE DEFENSE GOT ONE THING RIGHT at Donald Trump’s Senate trial. The case against him was thin, his team kept saying; and so it was, compared to the enormity of this administration’s other offenses.

Set aside the hate-mongering and the stream of conspiracy theories and demagogic bombast. Trump has sowed corruption of a breadth and brazenness unseen in the far-from-innocent annals of our nation’s history. In three years as president, he has transformed the executive branch into a giant favor factory, populated with the agents or willing partners of virtually every special interest. Add up all the routine, daily outrages—the quasi-bribery and quasi-extortion, the private raids on public funds, the handouts to the undeserving, the massive flow of cash, jobs, and freebies back in return—and Trump’s attempt to squeeze a little re-election help out of the fragile government of a desperate Eastern European country does not loom particularly large in the reckoning.

Adding it all up is a challenge, though. It’s hard to fathom the depths of the kleptocracy when there’s so much happening on the surface to divert us. The corruption most directly in our faces involves the looting and skimming and self-dealing of the president and his family. Our first hotel-owning president has inspired a parade of foreign diplomats and domestic lobbyists to pay tribute with overnight stays that are functionally indistinguishable from bribes. The Secret Service has blown over half a million dollars on golf carts protecting a leader who has spent nearly one out of every three days of his first term at one of his resort properties, which get free advertising on top of the revenue from lodging his guards and retinue. Ivanka Trump snags a valuable set of Chinese trademarks on the same day she dines with Xi Jinping. Kellyanne Conway hawks Ivanka’s products in TV interviews.

But the personal corruption of the Trumps themselves perversely masks the sliminess perpetrated by literally thousands of presidential appointees, from Cabinet officials to obscure functionaries. Amid all the distractions, it’s hard to focus on the more consequential crookedness and follow out the plotlines of all the sordid stories, and grasp the brutal consequences visited upon countless people. We lunge from scandal to scandal without ever filling in the bigger picture, or taking proper account of all the knaves, thieves, and corporate stooges and their handiwork.

Hard, but worth doing—an undertaking commenced here and continued and expanded online at https://prospect.org/mappingcorruption, with an interactive, agency-by-agency exhibit of the major offenses thus far committed. Only by traveling to the far corners of this swamp, looking through the muck, and drawing up a map of the territory—the stories both known and unknown—can we begin to understand our times.

CONSIDER THE ISSUE of immigration. At its mention, some Americans conjure up images of dark-skinned interlopers threatening to steal our jobs or live idly off our public services, while others are more likely to think of children cruelly separated from parents and desperate asylum seekers stuck in Orwellian turnaround. Either way, we tend to overlook a big central fact of today’s immigration policy: the huge sums of money drawn from the U.S. Treasury in the name of guarding our borders, and deposited into the coffers of a booming private-prison industry.

The two giants in that field, GEO Group and CoreCivic, run a combined 41 facilities housing more than half the detainees held in custody by the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit, known as ICE; as of mid-2019, GEO and CoreCivic had collected an estimated $2.9 billion for their services—a huge haul reflecting a remarkable reversal of their fortunes, directly traceable to Trump and his homeland security team.

A cloud had descended over their line of business before the 2016 election. After a succession of scandals involving substandard medical care, deaths, suicides, sexual abuse, and exploitative labor practices, the Obama Justice Department had announced a phaseout of the private sector’s role in the federal prison system. While the Department of Homeland Security pointedly excused itself from the new policy, it nevertheless posed a serious threat to the industry’s future. And the industry responded: Just a day later, a GEO subsidiary gave $100,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC. GEO-associated executives and entities went on to contribute another $350,000 for transmittal to Trump and other Republican campaigns, plus $225,000 to help finance the Trump inaugural festivities. When Jeff Sessions got tapped for attorney general, GEO Group hired two former Sessions Senate aides, David Stewart and Ryan Robichaux, to lobby on its behalf. A month after Inauguration Day, Sessions revoked the Obama-era guidance, by which time GEO’s stock market value had doubled, and CoreCivic’s was up 140 percent. “Thanks to President Donald Trump,” CNN observed, “America’s private prisons appear to be entering a golden age.” And thank President Trump they did, in the form of roughly $1 million in contributions to his election and re-election campaigns, at last count.

The payday lending industry made a parallel comeback, courtesy of the Trump administration’s decision to cancel an Obama-era plan to protect borrowers from being sucked into long-term debt at triple-digit interest. An estimated $2.2 million donated by payday groups to the Trump campaign and inaugural committees during the 2016 election cycle spurred this shift, and payday lenders weren’t shy about their intent. The Washington Post caught Mike Hodges, CEO of the mega-chain lender Advance Financial, telling industry peers that money put into the Trump cause would mean access to top administration officials. “I’ve gone to [Republican National Committee chair] Ronna McDaniel and said, ‘Ronna, I need help on something,’” Hodges said on an industry webinar. “She’s been able to call over to the White House and say, ‘Hey, we have one of our large givers. They need an audience.’”

The turning point for payday loan executives came when Richard Cordray, the Obama-era head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, stepped down, and Trump’s top budget official and noted CFPB-phobe Mick Mulvaney stepped in to replace him. The validity of Mulvaney’s appointment was contested, since it went against the fairly explicit succession provisions of the legislation creating the bureau. The White House took care of that problem by having its Office of Legal Counsel provide a supportive memo. Its author, Steven Engel, had been the lead attorney for a payday lender in a dispute over charges that the CFPB would eventually drop —after Mulvaney took charge.

LIKE CON MEN everywhere, our president relies on misdirection, using words to distract from deeds. Every bit of airtime or mental space claimed by one of his performances is attention deflected from his government and the actions of his appointees—the former coal lobbyist charged with protecting our air and water, the pharma executive guiding health care policy, the oil lobbyist at the Department of the Interior, the Raytheon lobbyist at the Department of Defense, the telecom lawyer chairing the Federal Communications Commission, the ex–Goldman Sachs lawyer (married to an ex–Goldman Sachs executive) heading up the Securities and Exchange Commission, the ex–Goldman Sachs partner directing the Treasury Department, the shipping heiress running the Transportation Department, the private equity tycoon holding down the Commerce Department, and the auto industry lobbyist over at Energy. That’s a partial list.

“One of the overarching narratives of the Trump administration is the total handover of the levers of government to corporations, and particularly the empowering of corporate representatives to oversee the very companies they worked for,” says Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, the venerable and still-toothy ethics watchdog. “That is the defining story of this administration, and it’s been badly underreported and underappreciated due to the whole Trump circus. It’s more extreme than anything we’ve seen. It’s all-pervasive. It includes a lot of examples that look like parodies.”

Personnel is policy, the saying goes, and it has never been so horribly true. Holding the post of secretary of commerce, for example, is Wilbur Ross, whose private equity firm paid a $2.3 million fine in 2016 over undisclosed fees charged to investment partners, and who went on to be described by Forbes magazine as “among the biggest grifters in American history” for siphoning an estimated $120 million from unhappy former associates. Ross made his name and fortune by seizing control of financially shaky companies, clearing their debts for pennies on the dollar, and unloading the remaining assets for a quick buck, sometimes after walking away from worker health and pension obligations. For nearly a year after his confirmation, Ross retained his ownership in a shipping company named Navigator Holdings, tied to Russian oligarchs and members of Vladimir Putin’s family. The Commerce Department is deeply involved in commercial shipping matters; the department logo features an actual ship. Just the same, before selling his stake in Navigator, which happens to own “the world’s largest fleet of natural gas carriers,” Ross personally negotiated a deal to facilitate the export of American-produced liquefied natural gas to China. The ethics officer who signed off on Ross’s continued investment got a promotion.

Betsy DeVos came to the administration’s notice through her work as a leading Republican donor and bundler, drawing on the fortune made by her father-in-law, Richard M. DeVos, from the multilevel-marketing giant Amway. At the Education Department, she gave a bunch of top jobs to people formerly employed by the likes of Career Education, Bridgepoint, and DeVry—for-profit college companies that had paid fines or made settlements over charges of deceptive marketing and inflated job-placement statistics. She and her team have treated that industry with remarkable solicitude, insisting that the defrauded former students of Corinthian and ITT go on making loan payments and maintaining the flow of federal funds to some of the smarmiest for-profit schools still on the scene.

Everest Institute is a now-defunct for-profit college. For-profit college executives are littered throughout Betsy DeVos’s Education Department.

Meanwhile, DeVos’s policies have left tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, police officers, and others unable to realize any practical benefit from a congressionally mandated program of public-service loan forgiveness. DeVos would appear to wield more than a typical Cabinet officer’s clout in this administration, to judge, anyway, by the fate of a presidential demand for measures to ease the impact of $1.5 trillion in ballooning student debt on millions of recent college attendees and the state of the economy. DeVos, whose department would have to implement this directive, has essentially ignored it; and Trump, whose re-election prospects depend on her money and Michigan campaign ties, has done nothing to force the issue. So the president of the United States is blocked from his desired goal by a functionary whose wealth confers political protection.

DeVos has achieved a certain cartoon-style celebrity through her hapless confirmation testimony and evident scorn for the public schools. By contrast, the pervasive corruption of the Interior Department under David Bernhardt has received comparatively little notice. Bernhardt was a longtime partner with the Denver law and lobbying firm of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, collecting at least $4.5 million from a roster of mining, oil, and gas clients. He replaced one of the administration’s penny-ante grifters, Ryan Zinke, who had become too much of an embarrassment by trying to spend $139,000 on six new office doors in addition to using government resources for travel with his wife. Bernhardt would soon disclose 20 separate declared conflicts of interest, deciding in what he must have imagined as an expression of transparency to carry the list around with him on an index card. It is far from clear, however, that his list had much effect on his conduct.

Under his leadership, Interior has moved to grant a long-term water supply contract to the Fresno-based Westlands Water District, a big former client of Bernhardt’s and a supplier of water to large almond growers and other agribusinesses in Northern California, potentially at the expense of San Francisco residents who depend on the same source of supply. As deputy secretary in 2017, Bernhardt pushed to weaken protections for fish in order to justify giving more water to Westlands—an issue on which he had recently lobbied. Documents released by Friends of the Earth show Bernhardt taking part in multiple meetings on the issue, even when the rules said he shouldn’t.

In all, Bernhardt’s department has opened a million acres of California land to fracking and oil drilling, while taking friendly action on a total of 25 measures sought or supported by former clients, according to the Center for Western Priorities. In addition to this stream of services to those he once represented, Bernhardt’s tenure has been a windfall for his former (and possibly future) firm. Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck has quadrupled its revenues during his time as a Cabinet secretary. No one should be concerned about any of this, Bernhardt assured The New York Times, because “Everything I do, I go to our ethics officers first.”

The personal corruption of the Trumps themselves perversely masks the sliminess perpetrated by literally thousands of presidential appointees.

Elaine Chao arrived with a shorter list of conflicts, but with a remarkably easygoing posture toward ethics. She would be leading the department that regulates international shipping while her father and other family members ran a huge international shipping business that builds ships in Chinese-government-run facilities and has received hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from a bank tied to China’s authoritarian regime. At the same time, she would be overseeing the distribution of federal transportation funds to states and localities across the country while her husband, Mitch McConnell, served as Senate majority leader. To make matters even messier, the financial fortunes of the couple rested on the shipping business: In 2008, McConnell and Chao had received a gift from Elaine’s father valued at between $5 million and $25 million, according to federal disclosures.

Critics of the Chao nomination spoke of the danger of her participation in decisions benefiting either the family business or her husband’s political career. In office, she has abundantly justified both concerns. A New York Times investigation last year identified numerous actions taken by Chao or her department that could be advantageous to the family business; they included public appearances with her father and a planned joint trip to China to meet with government officials there. Under the secretary’s leadership, the department has moved to cut subsidies for cargo shippers that compete with her family’s business. Until June 2019, moreover, she had failed to sell her holdings in Vulcan, a manufacturer of road construction materials—a line of business profoundly affected by Department of Transportation policies. She took action to divest only after The Wall Street Journal revealed her continued stake.

Meanwhile, Chao set up a special pipeline for Kentucky transportation projects, overseen by a top deputy, Todd Inman, who had previously worked for McConnell. At last report, DOT had authorized grants in Kentucky totaling at least $78 million during the run-up to her husband’s 2020 re-election campaign. One highway improvement project went to a McConnell political stronghold, Paducah, that had been twice rejected for previous grant applications. Chao was not bashful about her role: “I try not to come empty-handed,” she quipped at a Lexington, Kentucky, event where she announced a $2.3 million grant to the local transit authority.

Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s loyal finance director in the 2016 campaign, got personally rich while working for Goldman Sachs as a specialist in the kind of private-label mortgage securities that nearly wrecked the global economy. He got even richer by capitalizing on the carnage to buy a failing, scandal-stained bank on the cheap and carry out 36,000 foreclosures (many involving high-risk reverse mortgages marketed to elderly homeowners) while collecting federal subsidies intended to help keep people in their homes. In his first six months as Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin spent $1 million flying government jets; he would have used one for his honeymoon if lawyers hadn’t advised against it. More crucially, as head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and leader of the agency overseeing the IRS, Mnuchin became the administration’s point man in efforts to weaken bank regulations, obscure scrutiny of financial activities, and provide favorable tax rulings for wealthy individuals and businesses—an expanse of territory filled with opportunities for him to bestow favors on his industry cronies. In 2017, Mnuchin’s office released recommendations for tax regulations that were almost entirely lifted from a memo put out by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The list goes on and on. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has refused to commit to making a hypothetical vaccine for coronavirus affordable; Azar is a former executive with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, whose drug prices shot up during his time there. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue was a founder or part-owner in more than a dozen agribusiness companies; he personally collected $278,000 in farm subsidies from 1996 to 2004. While in Wisconsin for a gathering of uneasy dairy farmers at a time of widespread distress and a surge in suicides in their ranks, Perdue implied that they should just get used to it, telling reporters, “In America, the big get bigger and the small go out.”

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson ordered a $31,000 dining set for his office. Scott Pruitt, the now-departed EPA administrator, spent $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth and dispatched aides to purchase him an old mattress from the Trump Hotel. Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and proud crusader against “waste, fraud and abuse” in the Medicaid program, apparently had no problem with devoting $2 million of her agency’s budget to a personal PR campaign aimed at, among other things, getting designated one of the country’s top “Power Women” and gaining coverage in places like Glamour magazine.

To an extent uncontemplated by even the most business-friendly administrations of the past, Trump and company have filled decision-making posts at the subcabinet level with industry alums and apologists. Scott Angelle came to his Interior Department job overseeing safety and environmental enforcement after earning roughly $1.5 million on the board of an oil and gas pipeline company. Before that, he fought the BP-spill-triggered moratorium on Gulf Coast drilling while serving as Louisiana’s secretary of natural resources, a job from which he resigned when a brine company he was in charge of regulating created a giant sinkhole. Addressing an oil industry audience in 2017, Angelle gave out his cellphone number and advised his corporate listeners to communicate with him by phone in order to avoid leaving a paper trail.

One of Angelle’s colleagues at Interior, Assistant Secretary Doug Domenech, is a former oil and gas lobbyist who ran an industry-financed foundation dedicated to making the “forgotten moral case for fossil fuels.” The Justice Department’s first female associate attorney general, Rachel Brand, had been a lawyer or lobbyist for Google, T-Mobile, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, besides filing a friend-of-the-court brief that helped Citigroup dodge an admission of wrongdoing for its role in the sale and promotion of toxic mortgage bonds. (In February 2018, Brand left the administration to become a top executive at Walmart.) At the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Secretary Steve Censky had spent 21 years as CEO of the American Soybean Association, which lobbied against disclosure rules for products containing genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. Brooke Appleton, Censky’s chief of staff, had been a lobbyist for the National Corn Growers Association, to which she returned in February 2019. Kailee Tkacz, tapped to serve on a nutritional policy advisory panel, had been a lobbyist for the Corn Refiners Association, the National Grocers Association, and the Snack Food Association, battling against federal efforts to discourage excessive sugar and salt consumption.

In October 2019, ProPublica reporters attempted to count up the former lobbyists recruited into the Trump administration. They arrived at a working total of 281 —one lobbyist for every 14 non-civil-service job openings, and four times more than Obama had hired during his first six years in office.

Nowhere has industry capture been more extreme than at the Environmental Protection Agency, where the résumés of key staffers glitter with the names of such past employers as Exxon, Hess, BP, DowDuPont, Dynegy, Bechtel, Duke Energy, and (in multiple instances) the American Petroleum Institute and the American Chemistry Council. Even at EPA, however, it would be hard to find a more appalling case than Nancy Beck, named to head its office of chemical safety after holding a top job at an industry lobbying group, on whose behalf she had battled against an EPA proposal to halt the sale of a trio of chemicals linked to birth defects, nerve damage, and a disturbing number of deaths. Within weeks of her arrival, Beck was leading the charge against that proposal, based on the same arguments she had developed as a lobbyist, and over the protests of agency professionals who had been working on the issue. Was there a conflict of interest in there somewhere? Lest anyone think so, the EPA had its legal counsel compose a pair of “impartiality determination” memos citing Beck’s “unique expertise, knowledge and past experience” and the need to consider “all perspectives.” If the Senate goes along with President Trump’s wishes, Beck will soon be running the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

EPA is one of a number of agencies where public-interest advocates find themselves regularly dealing with officials who, in past lives, were working “directly to undermine the agencies they are now serving as managers,” says Andrew Rosenberg of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Agencies are increasingly making policy decisions without “the professionals even being in the room,” and putting out rules or guidance documents with no analysis or supporting evidence, he adds; instead, “It’ll just be ‘We’ve decided to do this.’”

Though Trump ran on ‘draining the swamp,’ anti-corruption sentiment boosted Democrats in 2018.

THE TRUMP administration’s sky-high turnover rate reflects, among other factors, its open hostility to dissent or indeed to an interest in facts. “You get the sense that … this is not a place for you to be exploring things that don’t agree with someone’s political views,” Lewis Ziska told Politico, after the conclusion of two decades’ work as a plant physiologist at the Department of Agriculture. His resignation had been spurred, he said, by the experience of seeing his superiors blow off a study of climate change’s impact on the future of rice-growing and the 600 million people who depend on it.

One thing you can’t get in trouble for in this administration is the use of official powers to see to the needs or whims of the president. That has proved to be a sound survival strategy. Trump’s original attorney general, Jeff Sessions, lost his job for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry; his successor, William Barr, has made himself indispensable by ordering investigations of Trump enemies and squelching probes of Trump himself. Mnuchin, for his part, has worked with IRS officials to keep the Trump tax returns on lockdown, reportedly overruling lawyers who argued that the agency had no choice but to turn them over in response to a House subpoena.

One thing you can’t get in trouble for in this administration is the use of official powers to see to the whims of the president.

The Treasury Secretary also had a hand in tweaking the rules of the Opportunity Zone tax credit so that it might be more readily available to rich real-estate wheeler-dealers. The beneficiaries we know about include Jared Kushner, former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, New York real-estate magnate and longtime Trump associate Richard LeFrak, former White House aide Anthony Scaramucci, and Mnuchin’s longtime friend, the convicted securities crook Michael Milken, who later secured a presidential pardon with Mnuchin’s further assistance.

By looking out for Trump, you gain a license to look out for yourself—that is the credo of this administration. Wilbur Ross accepted the task of cooking up a phony legal pretext for the White House’s effort to discourage Latino voting through the insertion of a citizenship question into the 2020 census, a plan stymied by the Supreme Court. In return for his dutiful service, Ross has been permitted to play a leading role in U.S.-China trade and natural gas export matters, despite his joint investment in the Navigator shipping company (along with a Chinese state fund) and natural gas concerns. In addition, he has conferred with leaders of state-controlled funds in Qatar, Japan, and Singapore, which had previously placed money with his private equity firm. He has also held official meetings with the CEOs of Chevron and Boeing while his wife owned shares in those companies valued at $400,000 and $2 million, respectively.

Officials of the Department of Homeland Security, including current acting Secretary Chad Wolf, have been steady cheerleaders for Trump’s cherished border wall, participating in promotional events that effectively double as re-election commercials. Meanwhile, a stream of DHS people have moved on to lucrative positions in businesses that rely on Homeland Security contracts. One of them, Scott Sutterfield, now an executive at LaSalle Corrections, previously ran ICE’s field office in New Orleans. During his time there, ICE began using eight new for-profit detention centers in Louisiana and Mississippi. Sutterfield then went to work for LaSalle, the company operating six of the new jails. Although he claimed to have recused himself from the contracting process, a colleague didn’t sound so sure. “Not extremely a lot,” said LaSalle Director of Operations Kevin Sumrall when asked if Sutterfield had been involved in decisions affecting LaSalle.

SINCE THE BEGINNING of his presidency, Donald Trump has managed to fend off two long official inquiries, one going as far as impeachment. Now that the goal is to win an election, some investigation-weary Democrats are counseling their party to go easy on the attacks and the whole subject of corruption, to concentrate on kitchen-table concerns and accentuate the positive in order to appeal to a small but theoretically crucial bloc of Trump-susceptible swing voters in swing states.

That way lies political disaster. “You don’t bring a knife to a gunfight, Donald Trump taught us that,” says Richard Cordray, who has watched the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he led for six years, get dismembered by Mick Mulvaney and other Trump hirelings. Cordray, who ran unsuccessfully statewide in Ohio twice (once for attorney general and once for governor), scoffs at the notion of the Midwest as a zone of comparative indifference to Trump political thievery. Voters everywhere react very badly to public officials “who steal from our pockets and stuff their own,” Cordray says.

There is plenty of evidence to support him. Since the financial crisis of 2008, polls show corruption climbing the ladder of voter concerns to a place near the top. Unfortunately, voters all too often set their corruption outrage aside out of a weary sense that things will be pretty bad regardless of which way they go. That perception was one of Trump’s triumphs in the 2016 campaign; it was achieved through a combination of his “drain the swamp” chants and his endless attacks on a Democratic nominee who had made herself conveniently vulnerable. He will no doubt deploy the same techniques again if Joe Biden is the nominee, pounding away at Hunter Biden’s high-paid corporate board gigs (emblematic, if truth be told, of small-time, bipartisan corruption that masks the much worse stuff), and ginning up whatever other scandals or pseudo-scandals come to mind. His assignment could be tougher if the Democrats end up making a different choice.

When corruption gets rampant and brazen, however, and when it is heavily concentrated in one political party, it makes for wave elections like those of 1974, 2006, and, indeed, 2018. Voters went to the polls in the most recent midterms with their heads full of tawdriness involving the likes of Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, and proceeded to oust a record number of House incumbents from office. Many of those legislators lost to Democratic challengers running on strong clean-government platforms and rejecting corporate PAC dollars.

Afterward, Nancy Pelosi was one of a number of observers pointing to corruption outrage as the biggest driver of the outcome. This was so, they concluded, even though party leaders had been timid about the issue beforehand, pumping out advice and talking points with an almost obsessive emphasis on health care.

This time around, Democrats enter the 2020 campaign with the advantage of an agreed-on corruption-fighting platform (the already-passed House legislation symbolically dubbed H.R. 1), and with the chance to put the crimes of Trump & Co. front and center. They can do so not only on the campaign trail, but, thanks to their 2018 success, in House oversight hearings, following up on the work of media and watchdog organizations. More digging, with this administration, is bound to unearth more dirt.

They can, above all, follow the lead of Elizabeth Warren (in a valuable legacy of her unsuccessful campaign) by drawing the connection again and again between issue areas where obvious and widely supported policies keep going nowhere, and the industries whose corrupt influence guarantees that. Corruption, in addition to being a powerful issue in its own right, can help the party transcend debates over potentially divisive policy specifics: Progressives and moderates may disagree about Medicare for All and a public option, but they can unite behind the foundational need to rein in the self-interest of the drug, insurance, and hospital industries. Trump’s industry-laden Health and Human Services Department exemplifies this kind of influence, and should be held up as a model—one of a great many to be found in the executive branch of government under this president.

Democrats must summon the courage, most importantly, to make the leap from denouncing Trump’s over-the-top personal corruption to acknowledging and challenging the more generic and abiding money corruption that, with or without Trump, gives billionaires and rapacious corporations and financial interests way too much clout, at incalculable cost to the rest of us and the idea of democracy.

As messy as things look right now, a referendum on corruption and clean government is the kind of election that gives the country, as well as the Democratic ticket, the best shot at a decisive victory. “Corruption is not a peripheral concern,” says Jamie Raskin, the Maryland congressman and constitutional law scholar. “It’s the very heart of what ails us … We have to elevate the anti-corruption agenda to the top of our political program.”",1
234,Bernie Madoff Biography,"Arrest and Imprisonment

However, Madoff became famous for a very different reason on December 11, 2008. The day before, the investor informed his sons that he planned to give out several million dollars in bonuses earlier than scheduled, and they demanded to know where the money was coming from. Madoff then admitted that a branch of his firm was actually an elaborate Ponzi scheme. Madoff's sons reported their father to federal authorities, and the next day Madoff was arrested and charged with securities fraud.

Madoff reportedly admitted to investigators that he had lost $50 billion of his investors' money, and on March 12, 2009, he pleaded guilty to 11 felony counts: securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, false statements, perjury, false filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and theft from an employee benefit plan. Prosecutors said $170 billion moved through the principal Madoff account over decades, and that before his arrest the firm's statements showed a total of $65 billion in accounts.

On June 29, 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin sentenced Madoff to 150 years in prison—the maximum possible prison sentence for the 71-year-old defendant. Madoff was sent to Butner Federal Correction Complex in North Carolina to serve his sentence, while efforts commenced to reimburse investors through the sale of his assets.

While imprisoned, Madoff learned of the deaths of his two sons—Mark committed suicide in December 2010, and Andrew succumbed to cancer in September 2014. Earlier in 2014, it was reported that Madoff had suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney disease.

Movies and Later Life

In February 2016, the story of Madoff's rise and fall was brought to the small screen for Madoff, a two-part miniseries with veteran star Richard Dreyfuss portraying the disgraced investor and Blythe Danner playing his longtime wife, Ruth. In May of the following year, HBO premiered the Barry Levinson-directed biopic Wizard of Lies, starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. The adaptation is based on the 2011 narrative nonfiction work Wizard of Lies: Bernie Madoff and the Death of Trust, by Diana B. Henriques.

In April 2018, the Justice Department announced that another $504 million would be shelled out to Madoff victims, bringing the total restitution to $1.2 billion. The government hoped to eventually return approximately $4 billion to his clients, though that represented just a fraction of the estimated $80 billion the disgraced investor blew through.",1

641,"Afghan warlord urges revolt against U.S., Karzai","In a threatening new audiotape obtained by NBC News, one of Afghanistan's most ruthless warlords calls for a revolt against U.S. forces and the “puppet government” of Afghan President Hamid Karzi.

In the 12-minute tape, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar also issues a direct threat to U.S. Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, the commander of the Combined Forces Command in Afghanistan. Addressing Eikenberry by name, Hekmatyar urges the general to stay in Afghanistan.

“It is easier for us to kill you here than to travel all the way to America to do it,” Hekmatyar warns.

“I would like to kill you myself,” he adds.

Hekmatyar also promises to exact revenge on U.S. forces in Afghanistan after American soldiers caused a deadly road accident in Kabul over the weekend. The incident triggered fighting and the worst anti-American rioting in the capital since the U.S. took over Afghanistan nearly five years ago.

Hekmatyar, now a wanted man in Afghanistan, still enjoys a large following among jihadists and hard-liners. Ironically, he was once allied with the U.S., during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. At the time, he was even invited to the Reagan White House, but declined. Hekmatyar first hosted the Arab fighters who came to Afghanistan as part of a worldwide jihad. He provided Osama bin Laden with the land for his first training camp, and remains close to the so-called “Afghan Arabs.”

After the Soviet withdrawal, Hekmatyar became prime minister, but then broke from the government and brutally attacked other warlords. His men once subjected Kabul to a continual barrage of artillery that killed thousands and forced 200,000 residents to flee.

On May 6, 2002, a CIA Predator drone fired a Hellfire missile at a convoy in which Hekmatyar was riding. The missile missed him but killed several of his compatriots.

In the new audiotape, he claims “Americans place no value on human life.” He boasts that “the resistance is growing in the cities and towns of Afghanistan and now in Kabul too,” and he predicts that Afghan’s “sons are willing to lay down their lives for Islam and for their dignity.”

In a videotape that appeared several weeks ago on al-Jazeera TV, Hekmatyar declared his support for Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network.",1
213,Fraudster Woodbridge banned from profession for 10 years,"CONVICTED FRAUDSTER Mark Woodbridge, the former group financial accountant of Torex Retail, has been banned from the accounting profession for a decade.

The punishment was meted out to Woodbridge, who was jailed for three years and ten months for his part in an accounting fraud at the company, following a disciplinary hearing led by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

The tribunal found that Woodbridge’s conduct “fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of a member and brought discredit to him and to the accountancy profession, in that he has been convicted by Oxford Crown Court of the criminal offences of false accounting and conspiracy to defraud”.

The convictions relate to the interim financial statement for Torex Retail plc, of which Woodbridge was the group financial accountant for the period ended 30 June 2006.

In 2013, Woodbridge was convicted alongside Christopher Moore, a former CEO at Torex, and former chairman Robert Loosemore of conspiring to defraud the former AIM-listed company’s shareholders between May and August 2006, by falsely inflating the cash/bank revenue figures of the company’s interim results by £6.5m.

Moore was jailed for 30 months and Loosemore for 20.

The trio created a false distribution agreement worth £5m between the company and Loosemore’s private company Magdalen Consulting, and a false goodwill deposit agreement worth £1.5m between the company and Loosemore.

All three were also found to have conspired between November 2006 and January 2007 to defraud shareholders by creating a false agreement between Torex and Magdalen which purported to vary the original false distribution agreement in order to sustain the original fraud.

Woodbridge was also found guilty of one count of false accounting between May and August 2006 by causing a further sum of £2m revenue to be falsely recognised in the company’s interim statement. He was acquitted of two other counts.

In December 2013, the FRC launched an investigation into the conduct of Moore and Woodbridge under its accountancy scheme. But in July 2014, it dropped its seven month probe into Moore because of ‘insufficient evidence of misconduct’ during the period in which Moore was a member of the ACCA.

The hearing took place at The International Dispute Resolution Centre, in Fleet Street, London.",1
369,Westpac to pay record $1.3bn fine after money laundering and child exploitation investigation,"Westpac has agreed to pay a record penalty of $1.3bn to settle legal action over money laundering and child exploitation allegations levelled against it by the financial intelligence agency, Austrac.

The $1.3bn figure is $400m more than the $900m the bank had previously set aside as an estimate of the penalty it would have to pay and comes after the bank said an additional 250 customers made transactions consistent with child exploitation – a dramatic increase on the 12 over which the regulator originally took action.

In a further concession to Austrac, Westpac has also agreed to additional contraventions of anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws, the company told the stock exchange on Thursday.

The deal between the bank and the regulator is subject to approval by the federal court.

In November last year, Austrac launched federal court action accusing Westpac of breaching AML-CTF laws more than 23m times, including by allowing a dozen customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a way consistent with child exploitation.

But in a statement of agreed facts, to be filed with the court, Westpac said that in December last year it “completed a review of all child exploitation transaction types for the Philippines, south-east Asia and Mexico over the prior three year period”.

As a result, it discovered an additional 248 customers who had been making payments in a way consistent with child exploitation, and reported them to Austrac.

In addition, Westpac said it had been banking two customers convicted of child exploitation offences who made suspicious transactions.

“Had Westpac conducted appropriate ongoing customer due diligence with respect to customers 261 and 262, these child exploitation related suspicions could have been identified earlier,” the bank said in the statement of agreed facts.

Most of Austrac’s allegations related to its dealings with correspondent banks, which it failed to properly monitor.

However, the child exploitation allegations drew the most public attention.

The scandal sparked shareholder fury and forced chief executive Brian Hartzer and chairman Lindsay Maxsted to resign.

Westpac formally admitted it broke the law in May, opening the way to a settlement, although it still denied some of the allegations.

And in July it said it may have committed an additional 450,000 breaches of the law.

On Thursday, Westpac’s new chief executive, Peter King, issued the latest in a series of apologies made by the bank.

“We are committed to fixing the issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again,” he said.

“This has been my number one priority. We have also closed down relevant products and reported all relevant historical transactions.”

Austrac chief executive Nicole Rose said the proposed penalty “reflects the serious and systemic nature of Westpac’s non-compliance”.

“Westpac’s failure to implement effective transaction monitoring programs, and its failure to submit IFTI [international funds transfer instruction] reports to Austrac and apply enhanced customer due diligence in relation to suspicious transactions, meant Austrac and law enforcement were missing critical intelligence to support police investigations.”",1
313,Enron,"The collapse of energy company in December 2001 precipitated what would become the most complex white-collar crime investigation in the FBI’s history.

Top officials at the Houston-based company cheated investors and enriched themselves through complex accounting gimmicks like overvaluing assets to boost cash flow and earnings statements, which made the company even more appealing to investors. When the company declared bankruptcy in December 2001, investors lost millions, prompting the FBI and other federal agencies to investigate.

The sheer magnitude of the case prompted creation of the multi-agency Enron Task Force, a unique blend of investigators and analysts from the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and prosecutors from the Department of Justice.

Agents conducted more than 1,800 interviews and collected more than 3,000 boxes of evidence and more than four terabytes of digitized data. More than $164 million was seized; to date about $90 million has been forfeited to help compensate victims. Twenty-two people have been convicted for their actions related to the fraud, including Enron’s chief executive officer, the president/chief operating officer, the chief financial officer, the chief accounting officer, and others.

“The Enron Task Force’s efforts resulted in the convictions of nearly all of Enron’s executive management team,” said Michael E. Anderson, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Houston Division, who led the FBI’s Enron Task Force in Houston. “The task force represented a model task force—the participating agencies selflessly and effectively worked together in accomplishing significant results. The case demonstrated to Wall Street and the business community that they will be held accountable.”",1
802,"Zim’s ‘most corrupt official’ reportedly found with R140m cash, ‘owned 100 properties’","An equivalent of one hundred and forty million rands in cold, hard cash. This is the amount Finance Minister Dr Ignatius Chombo was reportedly found with at his Harare home after the property was raided by the military last Wednesday.

According to NewZimabwe.com, Chombo is regarded as one of President Robert Mugabe’s “most corrupt officials”. The unverified claim that Chombo had bags of cash at his plush home was made by independent Norton legislator Temba Mliswa in an interview with Al Jazeera.

The revelations that Chombo could have hoarded this much cash at home, understandably to avoid queuing with ordinary Zimbabweans as banks are battling to dispense cash at several ATMs in the capital city, came as no surprise.

Described by Zimbabwe Independent newspaper as “undistinguished scandal-prone minister”, allegations of Chombo’s staggering wealth amassed at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans who are widely believed to survive on less than one US dollar a day (R14 at current exchange) first surfaced during an embarrassing divorce battle with his wife in 2010.

Further properties included two Bulawayo houses, a house at 18 Cuba Road in Mount Pleasant, a house at 45 Basset Crescent in Alexander Park, 2 Chetugu houses

The former college lecturer was embroiled in a bitter legal feud with ex-wife Marian Chombo, who told the Harare High Court she was entitled to half of the then home affairs minister’s assets. The sheer opulence of the estate left then prime minister and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai aghast. He likened Chombo to a greedy baboon trying to grab every cob from a farmer’s maize field.

Through his lawyers, he claimed he “didn’t own 90%” of the properties listed by the Herald, which quoted court papers submitted by his wife claiming he owned nearly 100 properties, 15 cars, trucks, safari camps and 10 companies.

332,Chihuri dossier exposes govt rot,"EXILED former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri has exposed how serving and former top government officials and service chiefs allegedly used their spouses as conduits to grab lucrative tenders in government and security establishments.

BY MOSES MATENGA

The ex-police boss, believed to be hiding in South Africa after he was hounded out of office during the November 2017 military coup which toppled the late former President Robert Mugabe, has submitted a 25-page dossier to the High Court to defend his properties which are under threat of seizure by the State over allegations of being proceeds of corruption.

He stands accused of diverting US$32 million of public funds to acquire a sprawling family business empire and properties in his 25 years as police boss.

In an affidavit filed at the High Court on Friday, which has opened a can of worms, Chihuri said there was nothing unusual about his wife, Isobel Halima Khan, through her companies, supplying goods and services to the police force as other service chiefs did the same.

Chihuri claimed Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga’s ex-wives Jocelyn Chiwenga and Marry Mubaiwa feasted on government tenders, supplying police and the army with reflective sleeves and serving as government’s travel agent, respectively.

Also named were senior police officers and their spouses, including former Senior Assistant Commissioner Charles Makono and his wife Abigail Makono, owners of Rewstand (Pvt) Ltd which also supplied uniform fabrics for over $10 million as part of promoting Zanu PF’s indigenisation policy.

“I saw nothing wrong in her (my wife) supplying, as most of the service chiefs’ spouses supplied things, eg Jocelyn Chiwenga supplied ZRP and the army with traffic sleeves, etc,” Chihuri said.

“Marry Chiwenga was a travel agent for government departments and a written instruction was given by the Office of the President and Cabinet for her to supply tickets for the entire government.”

He said a lot of senior officers across the rank and file, including his then deputy Godwin Matanga and wife, supplied “a wide range of vegetables and meat to ZRP amenities”.

“These officers supplied large quantities of beef, chicken, vegetables, fruits and goods according to their ability as a general practice in support of indigenisation,” Chihuri said.

He raised several constitutional questions about the manner in which the National Prosecuting Authority had set about hunting down his assets, and freezing them.

Chihuri said the June 12 “unexplained wealth order” which requires him to prove his innocence against alleged criminal activity violates his right to presumption of innocence until proven guilty, guaranteed by section 70 of the Constitution.

The order was granted by Justice Felistas Chatukuta following an application by Prosecutor-General Kumbirai Hodzi to force Chihuri and his spouse to explain how they acquired their vast empire, which includes immovable properties and companies.

Chihuri, however, claimed he was being hounded by President Emmerson Mnangagwa as part of a protracted fight that started during the liberation struggle when the latter reportedly snatched his pregnant wife.
He added that he was being persecuted for refusing to take part in the November 2017 military coup that toppled Mugabe.

The former police boss said his firms, NodPack, Adamah, Croxile and Mastaw were subject to processes of internal tendering by Matanga, adding that during that time, the Quartermaster (the late Senior Assistant Commissioner Earnest Muchenjekwa) dealt with over 200 companies.

“Why pick on these few if it’s not persecution?” Chihuri asked rhetorically.

He said to prove that he was being politically persecuted, all service chiefs who served under Mugabe were reassigned, except him, with some now serving in Mnangagwa’s administration as Cabinet, ambassadors or permanent secretaries.

Chihuri said his persecution had been extended to his farming business, where his grain was rejected by all Grain Marketing Board depots.

“As an example of the level of persecution is that, in the harvest season of 2017/2018, I took my maize to GMB (Grain Marketing Board) Shamva depot as usual. Four big haulage trucks (gonyeti) were returned with the load of maize to us, GMB citing that was an instruction given from above not to receive our maize or any of our produce.”

He said attempts to take the grain to GMB depots in Chitungwiza and Aspindale hit a brick wall until he ended up distributing it for free.

Chihuri also questioned why there were attempts to seize his upmarket house in Gletwyn built on two adjacent stands, and yet all top service chiefs allocated stands in the area were allowed to consolidate two stands into one.

He said as a result of the sinister motive, current Mashonaland East Provincial Affairs minister Apolonia Munzverengi, a former Senior Assistant Commissioner (SAC) in the ZRP, had grabbed records for the property.

“These records were subsequently grabbed by Ms Apolonia Munzverengi, who is the ex-ZRP SAC, and she is now minister and governor of Mashonaland East province, who claims that this ZRP housing project is hers,” he said.

“She has consolidated two stands in both phase 1 and phase 2 of the project. All this, with the concurrence of Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga, because he wants to get at me.

“We are not the only ones who consolidated two stands and bought more than one stand. Apolonia Munzverengi, our neighbour, put two stands together in both phases one and two.

“ZRP ex-Commissioner Oliver Chibage has consolidated two stands. Former Deputy Commissioner-General Innocent Matibiri consolidated two stands. Farai Matsika did so too.

“Honourable Vice-President Chiwenga has two stands there and also joined two other additional stands to make one stand, which is huge because it was earmarked for a hotel on a kopje.”

“As far as Gletwyn is concerned, my persecutor and tormentor Apolonia Munzverengi is persecuting me because she stole US$77 000 from the project and her runners shared US$23 000. That is the reason why she left the ZRP.”",1
859,Corrupt lawyer who was 'go to' solicitor for criminals is struck off,"A corrupt solicitor who was a 'go to' lawyer for criminals has been struck off.

Ross McKay, 41, was previously jailed for seven years after he assisted with a huge mortgage fraud.

Scott Rowbotham, 38, amassed a £10 million property portfolio across Greater Manchester, with the help of criminals and the proceeds of crime, including drug dealing.

McKay was jailed last year after a jury unanimously found him guilty of three counts of money laundering.

Police said McKay, a father-of-three, was the criminals' 'go to' lawyer, because he would not ask too many questions about their business or where the money was coming from.

Now following a hearing of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, McKay has been struck off.

McKay, who qualified as a solicitor in 2004, accepted he should be banned.

The tribunal said that McKay's actions had caused harm to the reputation of solicitors.

They also said his conduct was made worse because it happened over a number of years.

In January last year at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Timothy Smith told McKay: ""You were expected to be a person of utmost integrity and honesty.

""You fell far short of those high standards of professionalism, trust and integrity that are to be expected of a solicitor.

""You failed, as was your duty, to uphold the law and the proper administration of justice.""

Rowbotham, from Stalybridge was able to persuade lenders to hand over huge cash sums by lying about his income and forging payslips.

He was jailed for three years and eight months in May 2017, after admitting fraud and money laundering between 2004 and 2014.

Then in December 2018, Rowbotham was ordered to pay back £3,522,459 within three months, or face 10 years in jail.

It was the highest ever figure awarded by a court following a GMP financial investigation.

After McKay, formerly of Sagars Road, Handforth, was jailed, Adrian Ladkin, a senior financial investigator from GMP’s Economic Crime Unit, said: ""McKay was fully aware that the purpose of the transactions was to launder criminal proceeds and he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

""As a solicitor, McKay was in a position of trust, but he spectacularly failed in his legal duties through his corrupt and unlawful actions.",1

940,NURJAMAN RIDUAN ISAMUDDIN,"In accordance with paragraph 13 of resolution 1822 (2008) and subsequent related resolutions, the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee makes accessible a narrative summary of reasons for the listing for individuals, groups, undertakings and entities included in the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List.

Additional information:

Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, has been a senior Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092) leader with close ties to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and a long track record of involvement in terrorist activities. Isamuddin met JI founders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Ba’asyir (QDi.217) in Indonesia in the 1980s prior to traveling to Afghanistan, where he trained at Rasul Sayyaf's Sada camp and fought alongside and had contact with several Al-Qaida leaders, including Usama bin Laden (deceased) and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. After returning to Indonesia in the early 1990s, Isamuddin further strengthened his association with Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, Abdullah Sungkar and Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman (QDi.086).

Isamuddin was the head of JI’s regional “shura”, a policy-making body of the organization. He was also considered JI’s director of operations, which oversaw JI’s financing, and served as the primary interface with Al-Qaida. He was Al-Qaida’s operations director for the Southeast Asia region.

Isamuddin was involved in the 1995 “Operation Bojinka” plot to bomb 11 United States commercial airliners in Asia and directed the late 2001 foiled plot to attack foreign targets in Singapore.

In 1999, Isamuddin arranged for a JI courier to deliver a surveillance videotape of a potential bombing target in Singapore to Al-Qaida member Sobhi Abdel Aziz Mohamed el Gohary Abu Sinna (deceased), also known as Mohamed Atef and as Abu Hafs al Masri, one of Usama bin Laden’s lieutenants in Afghanistan. Abu Sinna’s instructions to procure explosives and to short-list men to execute the attack were brought back by the courier to Isamuddin, who made arrangements for JI members to train in Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. Following the first arrests of JI members by the Singapore authorities in December 2001, Isamuddin met and urged some JI members to persist in their terrorist plans, which included a plot to attack simultaneously six locations in Singapore with truck bombs.

In addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with Al-Qaida, Isamuddin and JI assisted Al-Qaida operatives passing through Kuala Lumpur. Between December 1999 and January 2000 Isamuddin helped several veterans who had just finished training in Karachi, Pakistan, including Tawfiq bin Attash, also known as Khallad, to facilitate the USS Cole bombing. Isamuddin was videotaped in a January 2000 Al-Qaida meeting with two of the 11 September 2001 hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al‑Hazmi.

Isamuddin also was involved in planning a series of bombings in Manila, the Philippines, that killed 22 people and injured more than 100 on 30 December 2000. One JI member admitted to Philippines investigators that Isamuddin was also involved in the bombing of the residence of the Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia on 1 August 2000, which killed two people and seriously injured the Ambassador. In addition, Isamuddin was involved in a series of coordinated bombings of churches in Jakarta and eight other cities on 24 December 2000, killing 18 people and injuring many others.

Isamuddin helped Abu Sinna find a scientist for Al-Qaida to take over its biological weapons program by introducing a JI member, Yazid Sufaat (QDi.124), to Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In 2001, Sufaat spent several months attempting to cultivate anthrax for Al-Qaida in a laboratory he helped set up near Kandahar airport.

Isamuddin helped Noordin Mohammad Top (deceased) execute the 12 October 2002 Bali attack that killed 202 people and injured 209, and the 5 August 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Isamuddin and his younger brother, Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan (QDi.218), established and led a foreign student organization in Pakistan called Al-Ghuraba, which was linked to Al-Qaida and the Taliban. The Al-Ghuraba group was formed to groom the next generation of JI leaders, provide them with training in weapons and explosives, and give them firsthand experience in militant operations. The group also served as a JI sleeper cell. Al-Ghuraba cell members were instructed on suicide and hijacking operations.

Isamuddin was sought by authorities in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. He was arrested in Thailand in August 2003 and was in custody of the United States of America as of July 2007.",1
236,China dumps Chiwenga over alcohol abuse and corruption,"The Chinese military has dumped Vice President Constantino Chiwenga as their preferred successor after the VP was fingered in corruption cases and alcohol and drug abuse.

An exclusive cable passed on to Bulawayo24 by an American diplomat in Harare reveals that some staffers at the American Embassy met with Chinese Embassy staffers and discussed the nature of Chiwenga.

The cable says Chiwenga is a corrupt person who is given to too much alcohol and substance abuse and practices rampant corruption.

China is said to have been routing for Chiwenga to take over from Mnangagwa in 2020 but he has not been behaving well.

The cable which was copied to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce revealed that Chiwenga is an extreme abuse of alcohol and some unnamed drugs which cloud his decision making and affect his heath making his chances of becoming a President less and less.

Spotlight Zimbabwe recently revealed that Chiwenga wanted to take over from Mnangagwa in 2020.

Exclusive details have unpacked that because of Chiwenga's health, the army was now targeting Gideon Gono and Saviour Kasukuwere as the possible successors to Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Kasukuwere is currently an asylum seeker in South Africa under the guise of seeking medication. He is joined by former G40 members who include deputy minister Godfrey Gandawa.",1
295,Treasury Sanctions Ten Venezuelan Government Officials,"Washington – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated ten current or former Venezuelan government officials pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13692. These individuals are associated with undermining electoral processes, media censorship, or corruption in government-administered food programs in Venezuela. This designation follows October 15, 2017 state elections in Venezuela, which were marked by numerous irregularities that strongly suggest fraud helped the ruling party unexpectedly win a majority of governorships.

Despite calls for an independent audit of the election results, the Venezuelan government proceeded to swear in the winning candidates through an oath of office before the illegitimate Constituent Assembly (Asamblea Constituyente or AC), further illustrating the authoritarian nature of the Maduro regime. In addition, the environment in which these elections were held – including censorship, the abuse of state media, and rampant corruption extending even to the distribution of food to Venezuela's starving population – raises questions concerning the freedom and fairness of the electoral process.

""As the Venezuelan government continues to disregard the will of its people, our message remains clear: the United States will not stand aside while the Maduro regime continues to destroy democratic order and prosperity in Venezuela,"" said Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin. ""We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials who are complicit in Maduro's attempts to undermine democracy, violate human rights, inhibit the freedom of expression or peaceful assembly, or engage in public corruption, unless they break from Maduro's dictatorial regime.""

Today's designations consist of the following ten current or former officials of the Government of Venezuela. As a result of today's actions, all assets of these individuals subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them.

Sandra Oblitas Ruzza is the Vice President and a Rector of Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) and the President of the Civil and Electoral Registry Commission maintained by the CNE. Oblitas Ruzza announced the relocation of polling stations only four days before the election. This activity disrupted the elections, as voters arrived and found that their polling stations had been moved.
Socorro Elizabeth Hernandez De Hernandez is a CNE Rector and a member of Venezuela's National Electoral Board. Hernandez de Hernandez was involved in the changes that were made to polling station locations in the days prior to the elections.
Carlos Enrique Quintero Cuevas is an Alternate Rector of the CNE, and a member of Venezuela's National Electoral Board.
Elvis Eduardo Hidrobo Amoroso is the Second Vice President of Venezuela's AC and was previously the First Vice President of the AC. Prior to joining the AC, Hidrobo Amoroso was the Director General of Legal Consulting of the Ministry of the Office of the Presidency, and he is also a former National Assembly deputy for Aragua state. Hidrobo Amoroso has publicly condemned an opposition governor-elect who refused to take the oath of office before the illegitimate AC.
Julian Isaias Rodriguez Diaz is the Venezuelan Ambassador to Italy and was previously the Second Vice President of the AC. Rodriguez Diaz, along with Hidrobo Amoroso, signed the decree requiring the oath of office before the illegitimate AC for governors elected on October 15.
Ernesto Emilio Villegas Poljak is Venezuela's newly appointed Minister of Culture and the former Minister of Communication and Information, and he has also held the position of President of Venezolana De Television (VTV), a state-run television channel. Under Villegas Poljak, VTV has curtailed freedom of the press and used state control of the media to restrict the democratic electoral process.
Jorge Elieser Marquez Monsalve is Venezuela's newly appointed Minister of the Office of the Presidency and the former Director General of the National Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL), a Venezuelan public institution. In August 2017, CONATEL removed two Colombian television channels from the air in Venezuela due to their coverage of former Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz, who fled Venezuela. In February 2017, CONATEL announced the suspension of CNN en Español from Venezuela after the network issued various reports detailing allegations against the government.
Manuel Angel Fernandez Melendez is the President of Venezuela's National Telephone Company (CANTV), and the President of Movilnet, C.A., a subsidiary of CANTV. CANTV has drastically increased censorship and blocked multiple websites from the Venezuelan public, including social media websites.
Carlos Alberto Osorio Zambrano is President of Venezuela's Superior Organ of the Transport Mission. He was previously the Minister of the Office of the Presidency, the Vice President of Security and Food Sovereignty, and the Minister of Food. In 2016, Venezuela's National Assembly audit commission alleged that Osorio Zambrano was complicit in swindling the state out of up to $573 million through corruption in Venezuela's food program.
Freddy Alirio Bernal Rosales is Venezuela's Minister of Urban Agriculture and heads the National Command and Control Center for Local Committees of Supply and Production (CLAP), Venezuela's government-run food distribution program. Bernal Rosales was previously designated by OFAC as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act on September 8, 2011 for acting for or on behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

352,Former CEO of Qwest Convicted of Insider Trading,"DENVER – Joseph Nacchio, former CEO of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q), was found guilty on Thursday of 19 counts of insider trading, capping the last major trial in a spate of scandals that tarnished corporate America over the last decade.

Nacchio, 57, was acquitted of 23 of the 42 insider trading charges. Federal prosecutors had accused him of selling $101 million of Qwest shares after company insiders warned him that the phone carrier could not meet its financial forecasts.

The 19 guilty charges corresponded to stock sales worth more than $50 million in April and May of 2001.

""This is an overwhelming determination of guilty,"" U.S. Attorney Troy Eid told reporters outside Denver's federal courthouse.

Nacchio's 22-year-old son, Michael, sobbed as the not guilty verdicts were read out in the courtroom but turned somber as the guilty charges were delivered.

Nacchio himself remained stoic as the verdict was read and later said he would not make any statements. His attorney, Herbert Stern, said there would be an appeal.

Nacchio's trial was the last in a string of high-profile crackdowns on corporate fraud that led to prosecutions of top executives at companies such as Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. Prosecutor Colleen Conry said the Nacchio verdict ""sent a message all the way to Wall Street.""

Nacchio will remain free on a $2 million unsecured bond and will be sentenced on July 27, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Nottingham said.

The former chief executive faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine per count at sentencing. He also faces asset forfeiture in an amount to be determined by the judge.

His acquittal on some charges may not help him during sentencing, according to New York-based criminal defense attorney Stephen Ascher, who has represented defendants in insider-trading cases.

""Although the jury acquitted him on a majority of the counts, for sentencing purposes that's unlikely to help the defendant very much.""

'SELLING BINGE'

Qwest, the third-largest U.S. regional phone carrier, became the target of federal prosecutors and regulators in 2002 after it restated $2.2 billion in revenue for the preceding two years while Nacchio was in charge. That investigation led to the insider-trading charges against him.

During the four-week trial, Nacchio's attorneys argued that he was an aggressive manager who was optimistic about Qwest's prospects and had not foreseen the economic downturn that hit the entire telecommunications industry.

They also said Nacchio could not have been planning to commit a crime because he tried to resign from his post in January 2001 following a suicide attempt by his son.

But several former Qwest executives — all of whom had immunity or plea deals with the government — testified that Nacchio set unrealistic earnings projections and withheld from investors that the company was masking its financial woes with one-time transactions that did not reflect sustained growth.

Prosecutors also described Nacchio's later stock sales as a ""selling binge"" that followed an April conference call in which he stuck by Qwest's lofty revenue goals.

Doug Stoneman said he and other jurors paid close attention to evidence such as an analyst conference call where Nacchio reaffirmed aggressive revenue projections.

""It was no longer plausible to us that that he didn't know that what he was doing was illegal,"" Stoneman said in a telephone interview.

Regarding the not guilty verdicts, which corresponded to stock sales from January through March of 2001, lead prosecutor Cliff Stricklin said jurors may not have been convinced that Nacchio had access to enough material non-public information at that time for those to be considered insider trades.

Ascher said the jury ""may also have been swayed by the fact that the sizes of sales got so much larger, that it showed an increasing desire to cash out ... presumably, the jury thought he massively increased the volume for a reason.""

During Nacchio's selling flurry in April and May 2001, Qwest was trading between $38.31 and $41.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, and plummeted to below $2 by June 2002 when he was forced out as CEO.",1
825,Rami Makhlouf,"Makhlouf, 45, is Syria’s richest man and a member of what was described during U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearings as a powerful “mafia” that also includes Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad, Makhklouf’s cousin. Before his country plunged into civil war, Makhlouf was allegedly worth $5 billion thanks to his control of monopolies and semi-monopolies in the air travel, telecommunications, real estate, oil and construction sectors. Makhlouf is on U.S. sanctions lists and is a known beneficiary of corruption. In 2011, Makhlouf announced that he was quitting business to focus on charity, an announcement met by many with derision.

File details

Makhlouf’s individual HSBC file linked him to at least 18 bank accounts connected to 14 client accounts. Six of them were numbered accounts. At their combined maximum in 2006/2007, these 14 accounts’ held over $27.5 million. He was beneficial owner of three of them: Polter Investments Inc; Lorie Limited, set up in 1999 and closed in 2004; and Drex Technologies S.A., which was registered in Luxembourg and was sanctioned in 2012 by several countries including the United States and Canada and by the European Union.

Despite repeated attempts, Rami Makhlouf could not be reached for comment.",1
397,Carlos Ghosn: Japan ask US to extradite ex-Green Beret and son over Japan escape,"Japan has asked the US to extradite a former special forces soldier and his son for allegedly helping ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn flee Japan last year.

Ex-Green Beret Michael Taylor and his son Peter were held in Massachusetts in May, several months after Japan had issued warrants for their arrest.

The US authorities confirmed a formal extradition request was submitted.

Mr Ghosn, who was detained in Japan on financial misconduct charges in 2018, made a dramatic escape last year.

The former Nissan boss denies the charges against him.

Despite being under house arrest and monitored 24 hours a day, on 29 December he managed to fly to the Lebanese capital Beirut via Turkey.

Details of the Taylors' alleged involvement in the escape are unclear. But Japanese prosecutors have said the two were in Japan at the time and helped Mr Ghosn evade security checks as he left.

In May, prosecutors in Turkey charged seven people over the escape. The suspects - four pilots, two flight attendants, and an airline executive - are also accused of helping Mr Ghosn flee.

They go on trial in Istanbul on Friday, with Turkish prosecutors seeking up to eight years in jail for the four pilots and the airline executive.

Full details of the escape have never been fully explained. Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, French and Lebanese nationalities, ran Renault and Nissan as part of a three-way car alliance.

He is accused of misreporting his compensation package, but has insisted he can never get a fair hearing in Japan.

Since his arrival in Lebanon, he has told reporters he was a ""hostage"" in Japan, where he was left with a choice between dying there or running.

94,"The Miami Herald Mon, Jul. 26, 2004 Talk of corruption trails Toledo","Special to The Herald

LIMA - Already Latin America's least popular president, Peru's Alejandro Toledo faces a growing list of corruption allegations against him, his wife, siblings and a top aide that could further undermine his government.

As Toledo enters the fourth year of his five-year term, he faces allegations that he took a bribe from a Colombian company and that his party, Peru Posible, forged some of the signatures it needed to register for elections in 2000.

He has denied both allegations, but a recent survey by APOYO, the country's top polling firm, found that 76 percent of people aware of the bribe accusation believed it was true. The poll also put his popularity at 8 percent.

Toledo also has had to juggle accusations of malfeasance by his siblings, as well as charges of wrongdoing by first lady Eliane Karp.

The onslaught of charges and the general perception that the administration is corrupt is a bitter pill for Toledo, who shot to the top of Peru's politics by promising to wage a frontal war on corruption.

BEER BRIBE

The bribery scandal involves allegations that one of Toledo's top advisors, Cesar Almeyda, took cash from Colombian beer giant Bavaria to smooth the way for Bavaria's buyout of Peru's only brewer.

Almeyda, who was arrested in January on separate charges for meddling in the judiciary, was a board member of Peru's Securities Exchange Commission. He has also served as Toledo's lawyer and head of his National Security Council.

Hugo Duran, a chauffeur working for a public relations firm hired by Almeyda, claims that Bavaria paid a $2 million bribe, half of which was funneled into a foreign bank account in Toledo's name. Duran has agreed to be a prosecution witness in the case.

Bavaria has flatly denied that it paid any bribes.

In another scandal, Karp is alleged to have used a Panamanian bank account in Almeyda's name to receive payments for consulting work she performed after her husband was in office. The opposition wants to know why she chose this way of getting paid.

While damaging, the bribery scandal is not as painful for Toledo as the charges that his party forged the signatures it needed to register for the 2000 elections against now disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. Toledo's sister Margarita allegedly organized the fraud.

The fraud allegations mirror the first major scandal to rock Fujimori's administration as he prepared to run for a third term in 2000. His party, Peru 2000, forged signatures to register his candidacy.

Fujimori went on to win the contest after Toledo, the underdog in the race, alleged fraud and pulled out of the race. Fujimori fled to Japan in November 2000 to escape prosecution on a wide array of corruption charges.

BIZARRE TWISTS

The accusations against Peru Posible have taken a series of bizarre twists. The principal witness in the case, Carmen Burga, later retracted her story and claimed she was pressured by opposition lawmakers to muddy Toledo's name. She disappeared after videotaping her retraction.

She received several passports for her and family members shortly after changing her story. The head of the immigration service was replaced after information surfaced that Burga's passport was expedited in a matter of minutes.

Peru Posible lawmakers in Congress deny the accusations, but also allege that any investigation into signature fraud should encompass all the parties that ran in the 2000 elections. Under former electoral laws, parties had to present approximately 1.2 million signatures to register for elections. The number has been reduced to 1 percent of eligible voters, or 130,000 signatures.

As prosecutors and congressional commissions investigate the allegations, opposition lawmakers are again calling on Toledo to step down or face impeachment hearings. He could face a much tougher time in Congress shortly if the opposition takes control of the legislature from Peru Posible in leadership elections next week.

''The evidence of corruption against Toledo is so overwhelming that he must be forced to step down now. He is so concerned about protecting himself that he is no longer governing. Peru does not have the luxury to have a president like this for two more years,'' opposition congressman Rafael Rey said.",1

38,U.S. charges two Chinese nationals who 'laundered more than $100million in cryptocurrency that had been stolen by North Korean hackers',"Two Chinese nationals were charged Monday with laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency that had been stolen by North Korean hackers, U.S. prosecutors said.

Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were charged in an indictment unsealed in Washington with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Prosecutors allege the North Korean hackers gained access to a virtual currency exchange in 2018 and stole nearly $250 million worth of virtual currency before laundering the cryptocurrency through several transactions.

Once they were in possession of the stolen funds, Tian and Li are alleged to have transferred money to various addresses to cover up where the funds originated

Two Chinese hackers, Tian Yinyin, left, and Li Jiadong, right, have been charged for laundering cryptocurrency valued at $91 million

The hackers used doctored photographs and fake identification to avoid scrutiny and used the stolen money to pay for tools used in other North Korean hacking campaigns, the Justice Department said.

Authorities charge that between December 2017 and April 2019, Yinyin and Jiadong were responsible for laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency.

They also allege the two did business in the U.S. and failed to register with the Treasury Department, as required by law.

The U.S. also alleges that North Korean co-conspirators are 'tied to the theft of approximately $48.5 million worth of virtual currency from a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange in November 2019.'

Prosecutors said those hackers laundered the stolen money through hundreds of automated transactions.

'The hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money laundering for the benefit of North Korean actors poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global financial system,' said Timothy Shea, the U.S. attorney in the nation´s capital.

In addition to the indictment, prosecutors also filed a civil forfeiture complaint to recover the stolen funds, which names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses that they say were used by Yinyin and Jiadong and their alleged co-conspirators.

Authorities say a portion of the stolen money has already been recovered.

The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on Yinyin and Jiadong, along with numerous cryptocurrency addresses.",1
172,Money Laundering: Austine Jay Jay Okocha Lands In Scotland Court.,"Augustine (Jay Jay) Okocha, former Super Eagles captain, and English Premier League footballer has appeared in court facing money laundering charges.

Augustine Okocha, who is better known as Jay-Jay, appeared in private at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Friday.

The 45-year-old global football star appeared at the Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Friday.

He is facing two charges behind-closed-doors hearing.

He faces one charge in relation to alleged acquisition, use and possession of criminal property and another relating to allegedly concealing, disguising, converting and transferring criminal property.

The appearance relates to alleged incidents said to have happened in the north-east of Scotland in 2015.

The Scottish Sun reports that Police began an investigation in 2015 which spanned two years before charges were brought against Okocha and six others – five of whom are alleged to have carried out fraud related to north-east businesses.

Okocha, who also netted 14 times for Nigeria in 73 appearances and starred in the country’s 1994 World Cup campaign, made no plea during the hearing.

The retired footballer, whose general address was given as Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was granted bail.

The case against him was continued for further examination. No date has yet been fixed for his next court appearance.

Okocha moved from Fenerbahce in Turkey to Paris Saint-Germain in 1998 for a transfer fee of 12.4 million euros.

The attacking midfielder also played for Hull City in the English Championship before retiring from the sport after the 2008/09 season. – SaharaReporters",1
586,Coal block scam: ED attaches assets worth about Rs 12 lakh in Jharkhand,"The Enforcement Directorate on Friday said it has attached assets worth about Rs 12 lakh under the anti-money laundering law in a case of alleged illegal allocation of a coal block in Jharkhand.

""The attached assets worth Rs 11.92 lakh include balance lying in the bank account of Hotel Le Lac, Ranchi maintained with Axis Bank,"" the central probe agency said in a statement.

The case pertains to DOMCO Pvt Ltd, its promoters and directors and other unidentified people for submitting ""false information"" while applying for a captive coal block and securing the allocation of 'Lalgarh (North)' coal block in West Bokaro Coalfield in Jharkhand, it said.

772,Philippines’ ambassador to Brazil ordered home after ‘mistreating’ employee,"YEREVAN: Guns fell silent in the Caucasus on Tuesday after a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan ended weeks of fierce fighting.
Hundreds of Russian peacekeepers were deployed in the disputed ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which broke from Azerbaijan’s control during a war in the early 1990s. The deal followed a series of Azeri military victories in their fight to retake the territory.
It prompted celebrations in Azerbaijan but anger in Armenia, where protesters took to the streets to denounce their leaders.
The Moscow-brokered agreement was signed by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Pashinyan described the deal as “unspeakably painful for me and for our people,” while Aliyev said it amounted to a “capitulation” by Armenia.
The full text of the agreement showed clear gains for Azerbaijan. Its forces will retain control over areas seized in the fighting, including the key town of Shusha, while Armenia agreed to a timetable to withdraw from large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh.
A Russian force of 1,960 military personnel and 90 armored personnel carriers will act as peacekeepers, for a renewable five-year mission.
The conflict over the territory, which has simmered for decades despite international efforts to reach an accord, erupted into fresh fighting in late September. More than 1,400 people have been confirmed killed, including dozens of civilians, but the death toll is believed to be significantly higher.

Azeri forces made steady gains over the weeks of fighting, sweeping across the southern flank of the region and eventually into its heartland. A turning point came on Sunday when they captured Shusha, the region’s strategically vital second-largest town.
The agreement caused outrage in Yerevan, with angry protesters stormed government headquarters, ransacked offices, and broke windows. Crowds also entered parliament and demanded Pashinyan’s resignation.
Police retook control of both buildings but the opposition called for a protest on Wednesday against Pashinyan, who came to power leading peaceful protests in 2018.
Pashinyan said he was personally responsible for the Karabakh “catastrophe,” but said the situation could only have grown worse. “It is necessary to draw lessons; this will help Armenia’s future development,” he said.
In the Azeri capital, Baku joyful residents took to the streets waving flags and chanting “Karabakh! Karabakh!”
“I am very happy, congratulations to the motherland, I hope these lands will be ours forever,” one said.",1
272,British banks ordered to freeze Hamas assets,"Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, said on Wednesday, the government had reasonable grounds to suspect that al-Rantisi and four others – Musa Abu Marzuq, Imad Khalil al-Alami, Usama Hamdan and Khalid Mishaal – may be involved in “terrorism”.

“This action has been taken because the Treasury has reasonable grounds for suspecting that four of the individuals are, or may be, persons who facilitate or participate in the commission of acts of terrorism and one, Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi, is or may be a person who commits, facilitates or participates in such acts,” the Treasury said in a statement.

Al-Rantisi said on Wednesday that the group had no intention of attacking US interests, pulling back from retaliatory threats by the group’s armed wing after Israel’s assassination of the Hamas founder, Shaikh Ahmad Yasin.

Hamas dismissed the British move as a publicity stunt. “This is not the first time we hear such stories … which only aim to deceive and mislead international public opinion,” said spokesman Ismail Haniya.

Al-Rantisi said Hamas’ activities were aimed solely at Israel.",1
439,3 arrested as Los Angeles toy company accused of laundering drug money,"LOS ANGELES – LOS ANGELES -- Three executives at a stuffed toy manufacturer were arrested Friday on suspicion of laundering millions of dollars for Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers, authorities said.

The arrests followed a two-year, multi-agency probe into the Angel Toy Corp., located in a downtown warehouse.

""It's no small irony that a multimillion-dollar company which promoted itself as retailer of cuddly stuffed animals was allegedly acting as a financial linchpin for drug trafficking operatives,"" said John Morton, director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Two co-owners of the business, Meichun Cheng Huang, 57, and Ling Yu, 52, were arrested, along with chief executive officer Xiaoxin Ju, 48.

According to a federal indictment, they were involved in a complex money-laundering scheme that saw representatives from drug trafficking groups drop cash at Angel Toy's downtown headquarters or deposit money into company accounts.

The deposits were always for less than $10,000 to avoid raising suspicion, authorities said. The money was then wired to China to purchase teddy bears and other stuffed animals. These toys were allegedly sent on to Columbia, where a businessman sold them and gave the proceeds, in pesos, to the drug traffickers.

The company's website depicts various models of cuddly toys available for purchase, including a 9-inch pillow shaped like a pig.

""You have these dangerous foreign drug dealers using cuddly stuffed animals as a way to cover their nefarious operation,"" California Attorney General Jerry Brown said. ""They must have been good at teddy bear sales.""

Authorities said Colombian authorities arrested the alleged reseller, Jose Cuevas Otalora. He will undergo extradition proceedings to the U.S.

The defendants are charged with conspiracy to structure case transactions, and Angel Toy is charged with conspiracy to launder money. Yu also faces a charge of conspiring to smuggle cash out of the U.S., and Huang is charged with witness tampering for allegedly pressuring an Angel Toy worker not to talk to a grand jury in the case.

""My clients maintain their innocence and look forward to being vindicated in court,"" said attorney David A. Katz, who represents Huang and Yu.",1
252,UBS fined €3.7bn in tax fraud case,"Published

Swiss banking giant UBS has been fined €3.7bn (£3.2bn; $4.2bn) in a French tax fraud case.

A court in Paris found that the bank had illegally helped French clients hide billions of euros from French tax authorities between 2004 and 2012.

UBS said it had consistently contested any criminal wrongdoing and would appeal against the verdict.

Following similar cases in the US in 2009 and Germany in 2014, the bank accepted large fines.

As well as the fine of €3.7bn, UBS has also been ordered to pay damages of €800m payable to the French state.

Last month, UBS said it made net profits of $4.9bn (£3.8bn; €4.3bn) in 2018.

The bank has set aside $2.46bn to cover potential losses from litigation and regulatory requirements.

'Systematic tax-evading'

The court found Switzerland's biggest bank guilty of illicit solicitation of clients and laundering the proceeds of tax fraud.

The French prosecutors had previously told the court UBS was ""systematic"" in its support of tax-evading customers and that the laundering of proceeds from the tax fraud was done on an ""industrial"" scale.

Prosecutors said UBS sent Swiss bankers to sports events and concerts to solicit clients.

Belgium investigates UBS for tax fraud

The court ruling follows an investigation lasting seven years. The bank had previously rejected a €1.1bn settlement offer.

In a statement, UBS said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the verdict.

""The bank has consistently contested any criminal wrongdoing in this case throughout the investigation and during the trial.

""The conviction is not supported by any concrete evidence, but instead is based on the unfounded allegations of former employees who were not even heard at the trial.""

It added: ""No evidence was provided that any French client was solicited on French soil by a UBS AG client advisor to open an account in Switzerland.""",1
472,Man Arrested In $2M Fraud Investigation Involving Crowley ISD,"CROWLEY, Texas (CBSDFW.COM) – A fraud investigation involves Crowley ISD after a florida man is accused of conning the school district out of nearly $2 million.

Donald Conkright, 61, is facing wire fraud charges.

He was arrested Friday, December 14 in South Florida.

On November 20, the school district said it learned funds intended as payments to a construction company were instead electronically transferred to a fraudulent account.

According to court documents, Conkright is accused of posing as an employee of that construction company and asking via email for nearly $2 million in payments.

In a statement, the district said “Crowley ISD remains financially strong and is working to prevent future fraud schemes.”

Here is the statement from Superintendent Mike McFarland:

Dear Crowley ISD community,

Crowley ISD was recently the target of a business email compromise scheme and is pleased that an arrest has been made in the case and wire fraud charges have been filed against a Florida man.

On November 20, the district learned that funds intended as payments to vendor Steele & Freeman, Inc., a construction company for the district, were electronically transferred via ACH (Automatic Clearing House) to a fraudulent account instead of Steele & Freeman’s account. The suspect, who has no connections to Crowley ISD or Steele & Freeman, is accused of posing as an employee of the construction company and asking the district to wire nearly $2 million in payments that were due to the fraudulent account.

Upon discovering this fraud, the district immediately contacted authorities, including the FBI, and began an internal review. Unfortunately, business email compromise schemes like this have become common with other organizations and school districts targeted.

Due to the ongoing investigation, we are not able to provide additional details at this time. I want to assure our community that Crowley ISD remains financially strong and is working to prevent future fraud schemes by reviewing our systems and putting additional safeguards in place.",1
568,"Israeli Bank Laundered FIFA Bribes, Aided Billions in Tax Evasion","Israel’s largest bank agreed to pay nearly a billion dollars after pleading guilty on Thursday for conspiring with US taxpayers to hide their money offshore, and for participating in FIFA’s international bribery conspiracy.

From 2002 to 2014, Bank Hapoalim assisted in the tax evasion of over US$7.6 billion by setting up more than 5,500 secret Swiss and Israeli accounts for its clients, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. From 2010 until 2015 the bank also laundered more than $20 million in bribes and kickbacks to corrupt soccer officials.

The bank agreed to pay $874.27 million to U.S. financial authorities for their role in facilitating offshore U.S. tax evasion, the second-largest recovery by the Department of Justice since 2008.

“The Department of Justice continues to aggressively prosecute banks and other financial institutions that help U.S. taxpayers conceal their income and assets in offshore bank accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman.

According to documents filed in a Manhattan federal court, at least four of the bank’s top executives, including two of its former board members, were directly involved in both “aiding and abetting tax evasion of U.S. taxpayers”.

“There is no excuse for a foreign financial institution to unlawfully assist wealthy Americans in flouting their responsibilities to pay their taxes,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Chief Don Fort.

The same day, Bank Hapoalim also agreed to hand over the more than $20 million it made by participating in FIFA’s internationl bribery conspiracy, as well as pay a fine of nearly $10 million, the Justice Department said in another statement released Thursday.

According to the Justice Department, it was through Bank Hapoalim Florida Branches, that executives of the Argentine Sport media company, Full Play S.A, were able to offer bribes and kickbacks to FIFA officials in exchange for broadcasting rights.

“This announcement illustrates another aspect in the spider web of bribery, corruption and backroom deals going on behind the scenes as soccer games were played on the field,” said Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney of the FBI’s New York Field Office.

“Bank Hapoalim admits executives looked the other way, and allowed illicit activity to continue even when employees discovered the scheme and reported it,” he said.

The largest bank in Israel, Bank Hapoalim was founded in 1920 during the British mandate period by the General Organization of Workers in the Land of Israel, known as the Histadrut, which would become Israel’s national labor union after the establishment of the state in 1948.

In 1983, the bank was nationalized by the Israeli government and held under its control until the late 1990’s when, in the largest privatization in Israeli history, it was sold to a group of investors led by Ted Arison, founder of Norwegian and Carnival Cruise Lines.

Today it is owned by his daughter, Shari Arison, who, as the richest woman in the Middle East, is worth $3.8 billion according to Forbes.

The Bank, which had several of its offshore entities leaked in the Panama Papers, was also found to have been embroiled in the bribery charges hounding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as a money laundering case involving the Katsyv family, which was sanctioned under the Magnitsky act, named after the lawyer who was murdered for exposing the largest tax evasion scandal recorded in Russia.

With 250 branches in Israel, as well as several international offices, its clients include Jared Kushner who has taken out four loans from the bank, the New York Times reported.",1
840,Chombo land scandals emerge,"FORMER finance minister Ignatius Chombo, currently in remand prison and facing a litany of corruption charges, is reportedly under investigation over the unprocedural construction of a business complex which accommodates CBZ Bank in Pomona, the Airport Road scandal and corruption involving land among other allegations.

By Elias Mambo

Sources said the Central Intelligence Organisation, which compiled many reports on Chombo’s alleged corruption, had forwarded the documents to police for investigation.

Chombo was arrested last week after being dumped at his house by the military which seized him as part of Operation Restore Legacy which saw soldiers storming some ministers’ houses and confining former President Robert Mugabe to his Blue Roof house.

He has appeared in court twice facing corruption charges and has been remanded in custody to December 8.

Sources said the police were investigating various allegations laid against Chombo over the years including those which the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye to, because of his close relations with Mugabe.

“At one time a dossier was prepared to and handed to Mugabe by the CIO for actioning but instead the president went on to appoint Chombo as Home Affairs minister. This was seen as a clear message that he was untouchable.”

During the inclusive government era, former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, also urged Mugabe to allow Chombo to be investigated for corruption allegations but Mugabe declined.

Investigations during the inclusive government era into the US$80 million Airport Road construction saga, Harare city councillors uncovered evidence that a controversial Estonian company, Augur, was being used as a conduit to fleece the municipality of millions of dollars and vast tracts of prime land.

Chombo, senior council employees and a caretaker commission which ran council affairs in 2008 were implicated. Copies of the council report compiled after the investigation were sent to Tsvangirai and parliament for further investigation. Council also threatened to approach the Anti-Corruption Commission and police.

The case against Chombo was strengthened when investigations revealed that a company owned by Chombo, Harvest Net Investments, shared the same address as Augur at 62 Quorn Avenue, Mt Pleasant, Harare.

The Airport Road deal was signed in 2008 and the project should have been completed in 2010 but missed targets due to abuse of funds. The project was eventually completed in 2014.

Chombo is also accused of fraudulently acquiring stand number 61 of Helensvale (also known as stand 61 of Glenlorne) which measures 193 716 square metres and another piece of council land, subdivision K of Nthaba, which he sold to a third party without paying for it.

Documents seen by this newspaper show that stand 61 was reserved for recreational purposes and it was not supposed to be sold by the city council.

“On October 4 1990 a full council meeting resolved to subdivide stand 61 and sell it to people on the housing waiting list as serviced stands,” reads part of the document.

“In June 1994 the decision to subdivide the stand 61 of Helensvale was rescinded after objection from the residents of Budleigh Park,” reads part of the report presented to the Serious Fraud division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) under case number IR 0407725 by the then acting mayor Charity Bango.

The documents also show that several applications by companies and individuals who wanted to buy the land were turned down, citing the resolution of the council pertaining to the use of that particular piece of land.

Apart from Airport Road, other projects under Augur included the Pomona Business Complex and Bluffhill Development which, according to the Harare City Council, were approved in violation of the Regional Town and Country Planning Act of 1996. It has now emerged that the City of Harare’s Highlands District Office had in 2012 called for an investigation into the construction of a multi-million-dollar commercial business complex in Pomona.

According to a letter to the urban planning director Psychology Chiwanga by the Highlands District Office on April 26 2012, Chombo gave the go-ahead for the complex to be built without council approval.

In the letter, the district manager said the construction of the business complex was not above board.

“Subsequent to a site visit made on 23/03/2012, a recent follow-up site visit on the 17th of April 2012 revealed that the Chinese developers are constructing a commercial building which I am informed accommodates CBZ Bank, etc, on a stand zoned residential according to Borrowdale Local Development Plan Number 32,” reads part of the letter.
In another case, ER-09/2011, Chombo is said to have sold council land to a third party without paying for it.

Documents reveal that on June 25 2004 the secretary for the Ministry of Local Government and National Housing, only identified as Simon Pazvakawambwa, wrote to the city valuer and estates manager, identified as Fransisco, requesting that subdivision K of Nthaba Glenlorne be transferred to Chombo.

“The above stand was allocated to Dr. I.M.C Chombo in 1995,” reads part of the letter dated June 25 2004.
On September 19 2005, Pazvakawambwa wrote another later to the city valuer giving details to effect the land transfer however contrary to his earlier letter where he alleged the land was allocated to Chombo in 1995 he stated that the land was bought for “Z$6301 on January 1 1997.”

After acquiring the land, Chombo went on to sell the stand to Alois Ndziva Chimeri on September 5 2003 “for Z$250 000 000 and the purchase price was paid in full.”

Questions have also been raised over Chombo’s wealth. In their divorce papers, Marian claimed she and Chombo owned businesses, farms, homes and residential stands in Harare’s leafy suburbs of Mt Pleasant, Alexandra Park, Greendale, Borrowdale and other towns around the country, luxury cars and vast tracts of land. – ZimInd",1
563,California man who flaunted his glitzy lifestyle on Instagram is sentenced to five years in prison for trying to sell $6 MILLION worth of fake artworks he claimed were by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat,"A California man who tried to sell $6 million worth of phony paintings has been jailed for five years.

Philip Righter, 43, was handed down the sentence in Miami Wednesday, after pleading guilty to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft.

According to the US Department of Justice, Righter's scheme involved buying copies of artworks by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Andy Warhol from websites such as eBay.

A statement from the DoJ reads: 'Once he had the forgeries, Righter tried to make them appear legitimate by creating letters that falsely certified their authenticity'.

In several instances, 'Righter created letters that appeared to be from 'The Estate of Keith Haring' and the 'Authentication Committee of the Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat.'

Righter 'designed and purchased embossers bearing the names of the estate and foundation for Haring and Basquiat. He stamped the forged letters with the custom embossers, trying to enhance the look of legitimacy.'

Additionally, he forged the signatures of representatives of the estate and foundation on those letters.

Righter sold the bogus artworks from 2016 through June of 2018, causing more $758,000 in losses to various art galleries.

Just before he was nabbed by the FBI, Righter sent some forged artworks from his home in Los Angeles to a South Florida gallery that had expressed interest in them.

Righter's asking price for the bogus artworks was a whopping $1.05 million, and he directed the gallery owner to wire him the money.

Investigators swooped before the transaction was complete, seizing the fake works.

A consolidated restitution hearing is set for September 30.

Despite pleading guilty, Righter has offered no public explanation as to why he engaged in the art fraud.

The Hollywood-based felon worked as a producer, and his Instagram shows him on various red carpets.

Righter's social media biography states that he is an 'Oscar, Grammy and Emmy Winner'- although that, too, appears to be a work of fiction.",1
956,Pharmaceutical Executive John Kapoor Sentenced To 66 Months In Prison In Opioid Trial,"Former billionaire and pharmaceutical executive John Kapoor has been sentenced to five years and six months in prison. His sentencing is the culmination of a months-long criminal trial in Boston's Moakley U.S. Courthouse that resulted in the first successful prosecution of pharmaceutical executives tied to the opioid epidemic.

The 76-year-old is the founder of Insys Therapeutics, which made and aggressively marketed the potent opioid painkiller Subsys.

Kapoor's 66-month prison term is substantially less than the 15-year sentence recommended by federal prosecutors, but it is more than the one year requested by Kapoor's defense attorneys, who maintained the executive's innocence and stressed his old age as reason for a short prison sentence.

U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs explained that she reached the lesser sentence after considering Kapoor's advanced age and philanthropy, as well as ""his central role in the crime,"" The Associated Press reported.

Kapoor and four other executives were found guilty last year of orchestrating a criminal conspiracy to bribe doctors to prescribe the company's medication, including to patients who didn't need it. They then lied to insurance companies to make sure the costly oral fentanyl spray was covered.

The painkiller, which was intended for cancer patients, could cost as much as $19,000 a month.

Two other executives pleaded guilty and became cooperating witnesses.

The other executives received between one year and 33 months, significantly less than many of the prison terms recommended by the federal prosecutors.

Earlier on Thursday, Insys sales chief Alec Burlakoff was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role in the bribery and fraud scheme.

""This was an offense of greed,"" Burroughs said before sentencing Burlakoff.

The sales executive hired a stripper as a Subsys sales representative to help persuade doctors to boost prescriptions. The woman, named Sunrise Lee, eventually was promoted to oversee a third of the company's sales force.

""I didn't think of who we were at Insys and how unethical what we were doing was,"" he told the judge on Thursday, according to Bloomberg. ""The only thing I could think was how could I keep up with the fast and furious pace necessary to get ahead.""

For the federal government, this was a landmark trial in which corporate executives were charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a charge often reserved for mob bosses and drug lords. Experts saw the trial as sending a message to drug companies that they will be held criminally accountable for their alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis.

""I think this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Brad Bailey, a former federal prosecutor and current defense attorney who has been following the Insys trial closely. ""It's a template that prosecutors will continue to use.""

While these seven Insys executives have been in court and awaiting sentencing, the company entered into an agreement with the government to settle criminal and civil investigations. Insys agreed to pay $225 million and admitted to the kickback scheme. Shortly after the agreement was announced, the company filed for bankruptcy.

Bailey said that between the prison sentences and the company's financial woes, ""there's no question that this was a cautionary tale to all executives.""

Ameet Sarpatwari, a physician and the assistant director of Harvard University's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics, and Law, thinks this trial will have a chilling effect on the pharmaceutical industry.

""It's an important warning to other pharmaceutical manufacturers and executives who may be considering pushing their products through aggressive, and possibly legally dubious, marketing schemes,"" said Sarpatwari. ""The consequences for such actions may not simply be fines — which has historically simply been the cost of doing business — but possibly jail time.""

However, he said, this successful prosecution does not mean the practices that contributed to overprescribing and addiction to opioids will go away.

""A lot of the activities that you see within the industry that are effective are technically legal. And so, if that's the case, is this going to curb those aggressive tactics? No, but it will give second thought to pushing the boundaries,"" said Sarpatwari. ""I think that is going to be the hopefully helpful fallout of the case.""",1
398,It's Not Easy Being a Yakuza Boss,"TOKYO ― These days the price of a standard civilian hit-job can run as high as $2 million. That’s not the price to get the job done―that’s the price if one of your underlings gets caught. The whole inflationary spiral started with one dumb yakuza stiffing McDonald’s on the price of a cheeseburger in Kyoto a few years ago.

The Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan’s largest organized crime group with 39,000 members and their notorious former underboss Tadamasa Goto (at left, from a 2005 video of a Yamaguchi-gumi celebration) are expected to reach a settlement this month with the family of a civilian killed in 2006. The surviving family members, represented by a group of 25 lawyers, filed the lawsuit last month, asking for ¥187 million in damages, or $2.4 million.

A potential key witness to the murder was extradited from Thailand on Thursday and arrested on the plane back to Japan―on charges of driving without a license―by Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department detectives, who were waiting on the plane. The police also plan to question him about the killing and, of course, his lack of respect for Japan’s rules of the roads.

The arrest has made all parties involved with the murder anxious to sweep the case under the table. Goto, former head of the disbanded Yamaguchi-gumi Goto-gumi, who has never faced any criminal charges for ordering the hit, is desperate to avoid being tried in civil court, and said to be willing to cut a deal. However, it's the current “CEO” of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Shinobu Tsukasa shown at right, who has the most to lose. At the time of the murder, he was in jail on gun possession charges, had no knowledge of the plan, and did not approve it, is not very happy to be cleaning up the mess. He doesn’t want to pay for a crime he didn’t commit or condone. Naturally. The whole thing is bad for business and terrible PR. It really damages the Yamaguchi-gumi corporate brand. And if the lawsuit actually goes to court, it could be a very bad legal precedent for “Yakuza Inc.”

According to those involved with the case and police sources, in 2006 Kazuo Nozaki, a real estate agent, was in a legal dispute with a Goto-gumi front company over the property rights to a building worth ¥2 billion ($26,000,000) in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo. On March 5 of that year, three members of the Goto-gumi waited for Nozaki to walk down a street in Tokyo’s upscale Kita-Aoyama area, and then one allegedly stabbed him to death with a kitchen knife. Of the three assailants, only two have been caught; criminal charges of ordering the hit were never filed against Goto.

The first hearing in the civil suit is tentatively scheduled for this month but sources on both sides say a settlement for the full amount is already being proffered by the Yamaguchi-gumi. A Yamaguchi-gumi middle manager said, “We don’t want this case to go to court. It could set a bad precedent. If this lawsuit were Apple versus Samsung, we’d be Samsung.”

It is an unusual lawsuit. Police sources say it represents the first time Japanese yakuza bosses have been sued for crimes pre-dating the 2008 revisions to the Organized Crime Countermeasures Law (暴力団対策法) which made it possible to hold organized crime bosses responsible for the actions of their underlings in civil court, by essentially recognizing yakuza groups as corporations.

Former National Police Agency officer and lawyer, Akihiko Shiba, says that since it is very difficult to prove the criminal responsibility of the top yakuza bosses, lawsuits are one way of seeing justice is partially served. “The Organized Crime Countermeasure Laws are administrative laws, not criminal laws. The 2008 revisions made it clear that designated organized crimes groups function like a Japanese company, and therefore the people at the top have employer liability (使用者責任),” he explains. Since 2008, there have been at least three lawsuits against top yakuza bosses for damages by lower ranking members. All were settled out of court. “For the time being the use of civil lawsuits against top yakuza certainly has a deterrent effect on the management. The damages add up after a time,” Shiba says.

Others would agree.

These days, being a yakuza boss isn’t what it once was. In exchange for supreme status you get blamed for everything. In August of 2008, three months after the countermeasures laws went into effect, the Yamaguchi-gumi boss found himself dealing with one of his low-ranking underling's unpaid McDonald's tab. That's because Japan's approach to its major organized crime groups (there are 22) is to regulate rather than ban. They exist in the open with office buildings, business cards, and even company songs. The yakuza are Crime Incorporated. And in Japan, the CEO has to take responsibility for the screw-ups under his command. (To see how many people a boss has to worry about, see the org chart below.)

A 38-year-old Yamaguchi-gumi member had ordered burger combo at a drive-through in Kyoto. He picked up his order, but then claimed since his meal had gotten wet in the rain, he owed nothing, and drove off clutching his burger and fries. (It’s unclear whether it was a plain hamburger or a cheeseburger, accounts vary, but it was definitely not a happy meal.) Several days later, a bill arrived at the Yamaguchi-gumi headquarters in Kobe from a very angry McDonald’s manager. The organization paid.

The cheeseburger compensation was just the start of a series of legal headaches for the Yamaguchi-gumi and other yakuza groups. Over time, and with additional revisions to the laws, and broader interpretations by the courts, yakuza bosses now find “employer liability” increasingly burdensome. A boss can be held liable for any damages his cohorts inflict in the course of their business activities, including extortion.

There are a number of things about the lawsuit concerning Nozaki's death that are different from anything preceding them. “If this case goes to court and the defendant loses, it could be a major setback for the yakuza,"" says a retired police investigator formerly with the Tokyo Metro Police, who had over 20 years experience investigating organized crime. ""It opens up a whole wave of possible lawsuits to crimes pre-dating the revisions. It may even be possible to sue in cases where the criminal statue of limitations is over. For the yakuza, at least the smart ones, this lawsuit is Pandora’s Box.”

Yakuza expert and the author of The Yakuza and The Nuclear Industry, Tomohiko Suzuki, concurs, “This lawsuit is big news in the underworld. It won’t stop the hits from happening but it will make people weigh the cost of killing an individual versus the money to be made.”

The Nozaki murder is still officially unsolved and who is ultimately responsible, criminally or civilly, has not been settled. The Goto-gumi member who police suspect of receiving the orders for the hit, Takashi Kondo, was assassinated in Thailand last year after an international arrest warrant had been issued. Dead men can’t be sued.

Tadamasa Goto, who is suspected but has never been charged with ordering the hits on Nozaki and Kondo, was kicked out of the Yamaguchi-gumi two years after the Nozaki murder on October 14, 2008, so his legal responsibility is unclear. Police officers call him “the father of Japan’s anti-organized crime legislation” because of his willingness to approve violent attacks on ordinary citizens generated so much anti-yakuza sentiment. He also jumped ahead of U.S. citizens in July of 2001 to receive a liver transplant at UCLA after making a deal with the FBI. Goto may no longer be part of the Yamaguchi-gumi, but he's currently operating a new criminal gang under the moniker Goto Enterprises (後藤商事).

And the current Yamaguchi-gumi boss, Tsukasa, has never faced a criminal investigation for the murder because, as noted above, law enforcement sources believe (and underworld sources agree) Tsukasa never gave the order for the killing, never approved it, and was in solitary confinement when the job was done. He did finally approve the banishment of Goto, while he was still in jail, via his second in command.

A high-ranking member of the Yamaguchi-gumi, on background, feels that lawsuit this time is decidedly unfair. This member explains, “Mr. Tsukasa has never condoned the killing of a civilian. The Yamaguchi-gumi under Mr. Tsukasa forbids dealing in drugs, theft, robbery and violence against ordinary citizens―that’s not acceptable. Extortion and blackmail, that’s another issue. Anyway, one of the reasons the Yamaguchi-gumi finally kicked out Goto is because he continually violated even our lowest ethical standards. And now, six years after the fact, we have to clean up his mess again.”

Goto may pay his share of the damages but he is balking about paying the bill for his former godfather (Oyabun), Tsukasa. Goto has supposedly told his associates, “Who do you think put up the bail money for the old man in 2005? That was my ¥1 billion ($10 million) in cash! He kicked me out of the organization. And he still hasn’t paid me back. He can pay his damages out of what he owes me.” In the meantime, Goto is not strapped for cash. His defiant autobiography, Habakarinagara (Pardon Me But…), was a bestseller after it was published in 2010 and his new “business ventures” are reportedly highly successful.

Attempts to reach Goto for comment, including calls to his private cell-phone were unsuccessful. Sources close to Goto said he is hiding out in Cambodia until the lawsuit is settled.

While it’s certainly hard to feel any sympathy for Tsukasa, you can see why it's a headache, at least, to keep homicidal sociopaths on the payroll. All you can do is fire them―if you can’t get them buried somewhere. And $2 million may seem like a drop in the bucket for a Japanese gang lord, but keep in mind with bail running around $10 to $15 million, it’s getting much harder to make a dishonest living these days.

553,"California Man Sentenced in $6 M. Art Forgery Operation Involving Fake Warhol, Basquiat Works","A California man has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for attempting to sell over $6 million worth of forged paintings he claimed were by Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, among others. On Wednesday Philip Righter, who resides in West Hollywood, pleaded guilty to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and tax fraud, per the Associated Press. He received a five-year prison sentence for the attempted sale of forgeries to an art gallery in Miami.

Righter conducted the scheme from 2016 through 2018, passing the forgeries off as authentic artworks through counterfeit documents, some of which were stamped with phony embossed stamps used by the estates of dead artists. He appeared to substantiate the documents by referencing the name of a gallery which previously sold works by Basquiat.

In his guilty plea earlier this year, Righter admitted to using a portion of proceeds from the sales for income tax write-offs. In October 2016, Righter leveraged what he claimed was an original drawing by Basquiat as collateral for a $24,000 loan, which he never repaid. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, the victim attempted to sell the drawing to an auction house, which quickly determined that the work was a forgery.

In 2017, Righter sold a purported 1983 work by Basquiat, bearing the artist’s “Samo” tag, on an art sales website for $50,000. After the piece was deemed a counterfeit, the website was forced to refund the full amount to the buyer. In his plea agreement, Righter also admitted to having knowingly filed fraudulent tax returns, including a false donation to an art charity, which resulted in his receiving a refund of $54,858. In total, his false tax returns cost the United States government more than $100,000.",1

According to a March 2006 Congressional testimony by DEA Chief of Operations Michael Braun, Operation Panama Express has resulted in the seizure of 350 metric tons (392 tons) of cocaine, and the arrests of 1,107 individuals. The OCDETF is based in Tampa, Florida, and focuses primarily on interrupting cocaine shipments en route from South America —especially Colombia.

Joaquin Mario Valencia-Trujillo[ edit ]

The most notable individual arrested as a result of Operation Panama Express is Colombian Cali cartel kingpin Joaquin Mario Valencia-Trujillo. Valencia was arrested on January 31, 2003 in Bogota, Colombia, and extradited in 2004 to the United States. The lead witness in Valencia's trial was Jose Castrillon-Henao, a former Cali cartel maritime smuggling chief who became an FBI informant in 1999. Valencia was sentenced to a prison term of 40 years, and ordered to forfeit $110 million. [2]

562,Mexico drug kingpin Juan José 'el Azul' Esparragoza believed to have died,"Juan José Esparragoza, one of the architects of Mexico's global drug trafficking empire – and a key figure in the Sinaloa cartel – has reportedly died of a heart attack at 65.

The investigative weekly Río Doce, based in the northern state of Sinaloa, reported the death late on Sunday on its website, citing anonymous police sources and people close to the family of the trafficker known as ""el Azul"", or the Blue One.

Radio Formula reported on Monday that the attorney general's Office had started an investigation into ""rumours"" of El Azul's death. The FBI's website retained the crime boss on its most wanted list, alongside a five million dollar reward for information leading to his capture.

The death of Esparragoza would be the second blow to the Sinaloa cartel this year, following the February arrest of its most famous kingpin, Joaquín ""el Chapo"" Guzmán. It would leave Ismael ""el Mayo"" Zambada, as the only one of the cartel's main leaders still in action.

According to Río Doce's sources, Esparragoza died while convalescing from damage to his spine sustained in a car accident about two weeks ago. He was reportedly taken to a hospital, either in the capital, Mexico City, or in the central city of Guadalajara, and had the heart attack while trying to get out of bed.

The story added that Esparragoza's body has already been cremated and there are plans to return his ashes to his native Sinaloa in coming days.

Esparragoza was born in the mountain municipality of Badiraguato, an area that has a long history of marijuana and opium poppy cultivation and has produced several of Mexico's most important traffickers, including Guzmán.

Esparragoza's criminal career took off in the 1980s within a generation of Mexican capos that emerged to dominate cocaine trafficking, occupying the space left by the falling fortunes of the Colombian cartels.

The Sinaloa-born traffickers went on to head cartels based in several other parts of the country, including Guadalajara, Ciudad Juárez and Tijuana. Almost all of the main figures from that time are now either dead or in prison.

Over the decades Esparragoza developed a reputation as an able negotiator and corruptor of the authorities, as well as peacemaker among capos, much of it based on the period when he worked alongside Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the head of the Juárez cartel in the mid-1990s known as ""the Lord of the Skies.""

In recent years Esparragoza's conciliatory image has meant he has rarely been publicly associated with the vicious rivalries within and between cartels that underpin much of the brutal drug war violence in Mexico since 2005.

He also maintained a relatively low profile that meant he was less famous than many of his peers, though security analysts say he was no less influential.

In February one Sinaloa source told the Guardian that he had seen Esparragoza walking through a shopping mall in the state capital Culiacán a few years ago accompanied by only discrete security.

""He was dressed in a grey suit and tie, and he seemed relaxed. He had bodyguards, but the last thing he wanted to do was attract attention,"" the source said.",1
341,Westpac bank chief quits amid money laundering scandal,"Reuters

The boss of Australia's second-largest bank, Westpac, has stepped down after the bank became embroiled in a money-laundering scandal with alleged possible links to child exploitation.

Chief executive Brian Hartzer will finish up next Monday.

Westpac was sued by Australian regulators last week for an alleged 23 million breaches of counter-terrorism financing and money-laundering laws.

Most of the offences concerned the late reporting of overseas transactions.

But the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) said some of the transactions were also potentially linked to ""child exploitation risks"".

Australian banking abuses 'driven by greed'
The Australian bank customers who lost everything

Among other failings, the regulator alleged the bank - the nation's oldest - had failed to adequately monitor the accounts of a convicted child sex offender who had regularly sent money to the Philippines.

The Australian government has described the alleged breaches as ""very serious"". The Labor opposition spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said the failures of Westpac in recent times were ""nothing short of disgraceful"".

Public pressure

Chairman Lindsay Maxsted would also step down next year, the bank announced on Tuesday.

The bank's board has faced significant pressure in the past week over the allegations. It included warnings by Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg that the prudential regulator had the option to disqualify executives.

In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday, Mr Hartzer said: ""As CEO, I accept that I am ultimately accountable for everything that happens at the bank.""

Mr Hartzer has been chief executive since 2015. He has been given a 12-month notice period and will be paid A$2.68m (£1.4m; $1.82m) salary during that time.

Westpac said chief financial officer Peter King would act as chief executive while a successor was being chosen.

Mr Maxsted said the board accepted ""the gravity"" of the issues raised by the regulator. Last week, the board said it felt ""deep distress"" at the ""notion that any child has been hurt by any failings by Westpac"".

Austrac has noted that each of the bank's alleged breaches carries a maximum a penalty of A$21m. Westpac's competitor Commonwealth Bank paid a A$700m fine for similar breaches last year.

The country's scandal-plagued banking sector was recently interrogated in a royal commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry- which found widespread wrongdoing in the industry.

Mr Hartzer is the third chief executive among Australia's ""big four"" banks to depart since the royal commission began in 2018.",1
168,Danske Bank boss quits over €200bn money-laundering scandal,"image copyrightReuters

The chief executive of Danske Bank has resigned in the wake of a money-laundering scandal involving its Estonian operation.

Thomas Borgen stepped down following an investigation into payments of about €200bn (£177bn) through its Estonian branch.

The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious.

Mr Borgen said it was clear Danske had failed to live up to its responsibilities, which he regretted.

""Even though the investigation conducted by the external law firm concludes that I have lived up to my legal obligations, I believe that it is best for all parties that I resign,"" he said.

The bank said it was unable to determine how much money was believed to have been laundered through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.

Shares in Danske fell 7% in Copenhagen following Mr Borgen's resignation and a lowering of its outlook for the full year.

Estonia's Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) said it was now examining the findings of Danske's internal investigation.

""The report describes serious shortcomings in the organisation of Danske Bank, where risk-appetite and risk control were not in balance,"" said the Estonian FSA's chairman, Kilvar Kessler.

The watchdog and Denmark's financial supervision authority will now consider taking action.

The FSA said that it had carried out thorough inspections of Danske Bank's Estonian branch in 2014.

The following year the FSA said it ordered the bank to rectify flaws in its risk control organisation. That resulted in Danske's Estonian branch no longer serving customers who did not live in the country.

'Massive tax scam'

The branch's handling of Russian and former Soviet money has also been the focus of an inquiry in Estonia itself.

International financier Bill Browder is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most public critics.

He has long alleged that Danske's Estonian branch was ""one of the main conduits related to the fraud"".

image copyrightGetty Images

In July 2017, he gave evidence to the US Senate Judiciary Committee pertaining to allegations that Russia interfered with the 2016 US presidential elections.

Mr Browder set up and ran Russia's most successful hedge fund, Hermitage Capital Management, from 1995 to 2005.

In 2005, he claims that the Russian government took over his firm and used it to claim a $230m tax refund.

Mr Browder was refused entry into the country for ""national security"" reasons, so he moved to London and asked his staff to move with him.

Magnitsky Act

Mr Browder said his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, refused to leave as he wanted to investigate evidence of what he said was a massive tax scam by Russian government officials. Mr Magnitsky died in 2009 while in Russian custody.

After Mr Magnitsky's death, Mr Browder embarked on a worldwide campaign asking governments to pass legislation to freeze the assets involved and deny visas to human rights abusers.

In the US, this law was passed in 2012 and is known as the Magnitsky Act. The UK passed a similar bill in February 2017, updating its existing Proceeds of Crime Act.

In 2013, Mr Browder was tried in absentia in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison for tax fraud.

Russia asked Interpol to arrest Mr Browder, but the international policing agency rejected the claim.",1
382,Rolls-Royce apologises in court after settling bribery case,"The engineering giant Rolls-Royce has apologised after it was found to have paid bribes including a luxury car and millions of pounds’ worth of cash to middlemen to secure orders in six countries, including Indonesia, Russia and China.

Britain’s leading multinational manufacturer made the admissions on Tuesday at the high court in London, a day after it was revealed that it would pay £671m in penalties to settle long-running corruption allegations. In a statement read out in court, the firm said it “apologised unreservedly for the conduct which has been uncovered”.

The settlement was reached with investigators from three countries – the UK, US and Brazil – who five years ago started to scrutinise allegations that the firm had hired middlemen to pay bribes to win contracts.

Richard Whittam, a QC for the Serious Fraud Office, detailed the findings of what he said was the “largest individual investigation conducted by the SFO to date”.

The agreement between the firm and the SFO – called a deferred prosecution agreement – revealed systemic and long-running use of middlemen over three decades. The court heard that:

• In Indonesia, Rolls-Royce gave $2.25m (£1.8m) and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an individual in exchange for a “favour to Rolls-Royce on a contract” for Trent aero engines to be provided to Garuda Indonesia. Separately Rolls-Royce paid a representative from a rival bidder to deliberately submit an uncompetitive bid on a contract Rolls-Royce successfully secured.

• In Thailand, the firm paid more than $36m between 1991 and 2005 to agents to help it secure three separate contracts to supply Trent aero engines to Thai Airways.

• In India, where the use of agents to secure defence contracts is prohibited, Rolls-Royce disguised its use of middlemen as “general consulting services”. The company also admitted paying to retrieve a leaked list of intermediaries after they were obtained by the Indian tax authorities.

• In Nigeria, Rolls-Royce failed to prevent bribery in relation to two contracts for which it was bidding. A middleman hired by the company paid bribes to public officials, although Rolls-Royce later pulled out of both deals, in part due to concerns raised over the fact that it had obtained confidential information from a competitor.

• In China, Rolls-Royce failed to prevent bribery in relation to the extension of a £5m cash credit to China Eastern Airlines in exchange of the purchase of engines for aircraft in 2013. Some of the funds paid were intended to be used for employees of CEA to attend a two-week MBA course at Columbia University, including what Whittam described as “four-star accommodation and lavish extracurricular activities”.

• In Russia, Rolls-Royce won a contract to supply equipment to the state-owned energy company Gazprom by making payments to a senior Gazprom official.

Sir Brian Leveson QC, the president of the Queen’s bench division of the high court, said the case raised questions about whether it would ever be in the public interest to prosecute a company as big as Rolls-Royce.

“My reaction when first considering these papers was that if Rolls-Royce were not to be prosecuted in the context of such egregious criminality over decades, involving countries around the world, making truly vast corrupt payments and, consequentially, even greater profits, then it was difficult to see when any company would be prosecuted,” he wrote in his judgment.

However, he concluded that despite the scale of the crime, it was still appropriate to allow the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and approved it.

Robert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International, said the SFO had presented “a poor case” for the DPA, saying: “This gives the impression that Rolls-Royce is too big to prosecute.”

He said: “There was talk about pensioners and employees, but no mention of the victims of corruption. The poor case could have been offset by details about the prosecution of individuals, but there was nothing about that. If these are not the circumstances for a prosecution, then what are?”

More than 30m documents relating to middlemen were examined by 70 investigators during the SFO’s £13m inquiry, and more than 200 interviews of current and former Rolls-Royce employees were carried out. Arrests and searches were made both in the UK and overseas. “It has been a huge task,” said Whittam.

The high court was told negotiations between the firm and investigators had been “concertinaed” to complete an agreement with US regulators before Donald Trump becomes president on Friday.

The settlement means the engineering giant will avoid being prosecuted by anti-corruption investigators in the US, the UK, or Brazil, although individual executives may still be charged. Under the terms, Rolls-Royce will agree to admit wrongdoing, pay the fine and submit to other measures to monitor its conduct over a specific period. If it does not break the agreement, it will not be prosecuted at the end of the agreed period.

Leveson said: “It is important nobody thinks that in financial terms the company is being treated dramatically differently … to the way in which it would have been dealt with had it gone to court. The big difference is the extent of the cooperation.”

In agreements announced on Monday, Rolls-Royce said it would pay £497m to the SFO. It will also pay $169m in penalties to the US Department of Justice and $25m to the Brazilian authorities.

The anti-bribery investigations have undermined the reputation of the multinational, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft around the globe. The car company of the same name is a separate firm.

Warren East, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, said: “The behaviour uncovered in the course of the investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and other authorities is completely unacceptable and we apologise unreservedly for it. This was unworthy of everything which Rolls-Royce stands for, and that our people, customers, investors and partners rightly expect from us.

“The past practices that have been uncovered do not reflect the manner in which Rolls-Royce does business today. We now conduct ourselves in a fundamentally different way. We have zero tolerance of business misconduct of any sort.”

Shares in Rolls-Royce jumped 6% on Tuesday after news of the settlement broke.",1
711,WHAT IS PNB SCAM,"PNB Scam

Follow

The Punjab National Bank scam relates to fraudulent letter of undertaking worth Rs 10,000 crore issued by the bank.

The key accused in the case were jeweller and designer Nirav Modi, his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, and other relatives and some PNB employees. Nirav Modi and his relatives escaped India in early 2018, days before the news of the scam became public. PNB scam has been dubbed as the biggest fraud in India's banking history.

How the 10,000-crore scam happened?

Bankers used fake Letters of Undertakings (LoUs) at PNB's Brady House branch in Fort, Mumbai. The LoUs were opened in favour of branches of Indian banks for import of pearls for a period of one year, for which Reserve Bank of India guidelines lay out a total time period of 90 days from the date of shipment.

This guideline was ignored by overseas branches of Indian banks. They failed to share any document/information with PNB, which were made available to them by the firms at the time of availing credit from them.

Nirav Modi got his first fraudulent guarantee from PNB on March 10, 2011 and managed to get 1,212 more such guarantees over the next 74 months.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recovered bank token devices of the foreign dummy companies used by the fugitive diamond trader to transfer the fraudulent funds.

The probe agency found that Nehal Modi, brother of Nirav Modi had destroyed the devices and had even secured a server located at United Arab Emirates (UAE) soon after the scam broke out. These dummy firms had been receiving the fraudulent PNB LoUs and were based out in British Virgin Island and other tax havens.

The enforcement agency has so far seized movable and immovable properties to the tune of Rs 2362 crore in the PNB fraud case.

How was the Punjab National Bank management oblivious to this?

PNB employees misused the SWIFT network to transmit messages to Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank on fund requirement. While all this was done using SWIFT passwords, the transactions were never recorded in the bank’s core system — thereby keeping the PNB management in the dark for years.

How did the scam unfold?

On 29 January 2018, PNB lodged a FIR with CBI stating that fraudulent LoUs worth Rs 2.8 billion (Rs 280.7 crore) were first issued on 16 January. In the complaint, PNB had named three diamond firms, Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds.

As of 18 May 2018, the scam has ballooned to over Rs 14,000 crore.

Who is Nirav Modi?

Nirav Modi is a luxury diamond jeweller and designer who was ranked 57 in the Forbes list of billionaires in 2017. He is also the founder of the Nirav Modi chain of diamond jewellery retail stores.

Modi is the Chairman of Firestar International, the parent of the Nirav Modi chain, which has stores in key markets across the globe.

He has 16 stores in diverse locations such as such as Delhi, Mumbai, New York, Hong Kong, London and Macau.",1
926,Two of Britain's biggest drill artists 'Skengdo' and 'AM' get suspended jail sentences for breaching a gang injunction against performing lyrics that incite violence against their rivals,"Two of the UK's biggest drill artists have been handed suspended jail sentences for breaching a gang injunction imposed to prevent them from performing music that police said incited violence against rivals.

Terrell Doyley and Joshua Malinga, known as Skengdo and AM respectively, have appeared on BBC Radio 1, performed at the Reading and Leeds festivals and received a four-star review in the Guardian.

Scotland Yard said the pair, who are both 21, were sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, at Croydon County Court after breaching an interim gang injunction.

Their manager, TK, told the Press Association the musicians were not involved in gang violence, but pleaded guilty after a video of one of their live performances was uploaded to the internet without their knowledge.

The injunction was made against the men after the court found they were members of a south London gang, and linked with rising violence in the Lambeth borough on August 14, according to the Metropolitan Police.

The force said they breached it by performing 'drill music that incited and encouraged violence against rival gang members and then posted it on social media'.

Detective Inspector Luke Williams, of Lambeth and Southwark's gangs unit, said: 'Gang injunctions are a great way to enable officers to tackle those involved in gangs and serious violence.

'Where intelligence identifies somebody is a member of a gang and the requirements of the Policing and Crime Act are met, we will seek to obtain gang injunctions to suppress serious violence across the Capital.

'I am pleased with the sentences passed in these cases, which reflect that the police and courts are unwilling to accept behaviour leading to serious violence. The court found that violence in drill music can, and did in this case, amount to gang-related violence.'

Skengdo and AM, who are linked to Brixton's 410 group, are one of the country's most well-known drill acts, selling out two tours last year.

Their YouTube videos, including a Radio1Xtra session uploaded this week, have racked up hundreds of thousands of views.

TK, the director of Finesse Foreva, said they were served with an injunction last year, banning them from going to certain areas, associating with named individuals, and placing restrictions on them making music and performing.

He said police at a hearing in January tried to link Skengdo and AM to the history of Brixton crime.

'They didn't find nothing on them in terms of violence because they don't have nothing on them,' he said.

'Last time they might have had any run-ins with the law was when they were 16 and 17.

'They started deciphering slang terms in court, it was all a bit weird.

'Deciphering slang terms to an old-head white woman who probably lives in the countryside or something.'

TK said they 'basically beat the case', but had to plead guilty over a clip from a recent live performance of their track Attempted.

A music video entitled Attempted 1.0 on YouTube has repeated references to associates being 'cheffed', or stabbed, and the rappers make suggestions for alternatives to avoid violent situations.

In the song, one associate is attacked buying chicken wings, which prompts the lyrics: 'Don't nobody know about UberEats?' When another is stabbed on the bus the lyrics ask: 'Don't nobody know about Addison Lee?'

The chorus goes: 'Attempted? Should've been a murder. How you gonna run with your burner? We're active. Let's go halves on a burger. Big Mac-10, can I get fries?'

TK said the rappers are still allowed to associate with each other and other 410 members, but cannot go to Kennington – the home of rivals Harlem Spartans, or mention their name.

TK also denied they had to pay for the Met's costs, as the force has claimed.

'Why the Met's probably done that is because they want to affect their lives, scare big venue owners off,' he added.",1
333,"Portuguese police raid top-division clubs Benfica, Santa Clara as part of corruption investigation","Lisbon: Police in Portugal have raided Benfica football club as part of a corruption investigation linked to player transfers, the two-time European champions and investigators confirmed on Monday.

The Portuguese general prosecutor's office revealed that it had carried out nearly 30 searches, including at the premises of Benfica and fellow top division club Santa Clara, in a probe into a range of financial crimes including money laundering.

Benfica confirmed the raids in a statement in which they underlined their ""total willingness to collaborate with the authorities"".

Prosecutors said they were investigating ""a range of cases, all linked to professional football"", adding that they were related to sporting and financial partnerships, the acquisition by clubs of players' sporting rights and ""loans agreed with a Singapore national"".

Broadcaster TVI reported that Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira is the main target of the authorities, who carried out the searches in order to move forward ongoing investigations.

TVI also report that prosecutors are focussing on the transfer of three Libyan players who signed for Santa Clara.

Last month real estate businessman Vieira was re-elected president of the 37-time Portuguese champions, who also won the European Cup twice in the 1960s, extending a reign that began in 2003.

Vieira, 71, is to be tried in a corruption trial alongside 16 other people, including three judges, and was also indicted in a tax fraud probe targeting Benfica, who have also been implicated in match-fixing.",1

853,DOJ Announces Indictment in Nigerian Banking Scam,"International investment scam laundered funds through US bank accounts before being sent to Nigeria.

It turns out that the fake Nigerian prince/government official/businessman who wants you to invest in a sure thing has a real name. Osondu Victor Igwilo, 49, of Lagos, Nigeria, was charged in a federal complaint filed in the Southern District of Texas in December 2016 and unsealed yesterday.

Igwilo is charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and one count of aggravated identity theft. According to the complaint, Igwilo recruited teams of individuals to send scam emails claiming to be from BB&T Corporation.

He then sent US citizens he had recruited to visit the victims in person to finalize the scam and retrieve funds, which were then laundered through US bank accounts before being sent to Nigeria. The total amount of the victims' losses were not disclosed by the Department of Justice in announcing the indictment.

Eight other individuals have been charged in connection with the scheme. Four await sentencing, two are pending trial, one is pending extradition, and one remains a fugitive.

Igwilo also remains a fugitive.

545,Money Laundering and Financial Crimes,"Overall anti-money laundering efforts in the year 2000 made progress across two broad fronts. The international community demonstrated its resolve to confront money laundering by showing a strong commitment to work collectively to address the problem while seeking to isolate those countries and jurisdictions that lack this commitment. In this regard, the year 2000 marked a milestone in international cooperation on fighting money laundering as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)(1) publicly released a list of 15 countries and territories that were found to be non-cooperative in the international fight against money laundering. At the conclusion of its June 2000 plenary meeting, the FATF published a report that stated that these 15 countries and territories had ""serious systemic problems with money laundering controls and that they must improve their rules and practices as expeditiously as possible or face possible sanctions."" Following publication of this report, the United States, its G-7 partners and other FATF members issued advisories, notices or other various communications alerting the financial institutions in their countries about the money laundering risks they face in the ""non-cooperating"" jurisdictions.

The publication of the FATF report represents the first step in an ongoing process to bring international financial centers into compliance with international anti-money laundering standards. The development of a consensus among the FATF membership was the result of a five-month process in which FATF evaluated the anti-money laundering systems of numerous countries in order to identify those anti-money laundering efforts that fail to meet international norms. The willingness of the FATF members to agree on this list demonstrates the seriousness of the money laundering problem in those jurisdictions and the commitment of the members to address it in a meaningful way.

This exercise has already shown positive results. Since the list was published, seven of the 15 jurisdictions have enacted all or almost all of the legislation needed to address deficiencies identified by the FATF, and now must demonstrate effective implementation of the legislation. Several other jurisdictions have enacted some relevant legislation to address the deficiencies identified by FATF. These jurisdictions are commended for beginning their legislative processes, and are encouraged to continue to work toward developing comprehensive anti-money laundering regimes that meet international standards. The FATF will be assessing the progress made by all listed jurisdictions to determine whether any should be removed from the list and will also continue its review process to determine whether any new countries should be added.

Further international commitment was reflected in additional advances by FATF and FATF-like regional bodies. Three countries—Argentina, Brazil and Mexico—joined FATF, increasing its membership to 29 nations. In addition, two new regional FATF-like bodies were created to extend the fight against money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force against Money Laundering in South America and the Eastern and Southern African Anti-Money Laundering Group were formed in 2000, increasing the number of regional bodies to five.

The December 2000 signing of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in Palermo, Italy represents another significant development in the effort to promote international cooperation against money laundering and other forms of organized crime. The Convention was signed by over 125 countries, including the United States, and will enter into force after forty have become parties. This Convention includes many significant provisions with respect to money laundering and international cooperation in financial investigations. Once again, the drafting and signing of this Convention demonstrate the recognition by the international community that it must stand together to effectively fight international organized crime and money laundering.

(1)The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of policies to combat money laundering.

The relationship between money laundering and foreign corruption was highlighted in the U.S. National Money Laundering Strategy for 2000, which called for numerous actions to be taken in this area. Most significantly, the Department's of Treasury and State, and the federal bank regulators issued guidance to help U.S. financial institutions avoid transactions that may involve the proceeds of foreign official corruption. The importance of such guidance was reinforced by the publication last year of a report by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. The report detailed how 19 banks that operate in Switzerland handled almost $1 billion in funds relating to corruption by the former ruler of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha. The report criticized several of the banks for weaknesses in their account-opening procedures or monitoring and reporting mechanisms. The report noted that ""[t]he Abacha case is a clear example of the international dimensions of the issue of the deposit of corruption proceeds in the financial system.""

In 2000, the political and diplomatic anti-money laundering efforts were complemented by an initiative from the private sector. In October 2000, eleven world money center banks agreed to a set of anti-money laundering guidelines—the ""Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles""—for private banking activities. The guidelines state at the outset that ""bank policy will be to prevent the use of its world-wide operations for criminal purposes."" The participating banking organizations are hopeful that other banking organizations and financial institutions will adopt the anti-money laundering principles that have been developed.

The FATF initiatives, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Wolfsberg Principles were some of the highlights from 2000 that have made contributions to stemming the flow of illegal proceeds around the globe. These international efforts should yield even greater results in the year to come.

Why We Must Combat Money Laundering

Money laundering is necessitated by the requirement for criminals, be they drug traffickers, organized criminals, terrorists, arms traffickers, blackmailers, or credit card swindlers, to disguise the origin of their criminal money so that they can use it more easily. Money laundering generally involves a series of multiple transactions used to disguise the source of financial assets so that those assets may be used without compromising the criminals who are seeking to use the funds. These transactions typically fall into three stages: (1) Placement, the process of placing, through deposits, wire transfers, or other means, unlawful proceeds into financial institutions; (2) Layering, the process of separating the proceeds of criminal activity from their origin through the use of layers of complex financial transactions; and (3) Integration, the process of using an apparently legitimate transaction to disguise the illicit proceeds. Through this process the criminal tries to transform the monetary proceeds derived from illicit activities into funds with an apparently legal source.

Money laundering has devastating social consequences and is a threat to national security. It provides the fuel for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials and other criminals to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. Crime has become increasingly international in scope, and the financial aspects of crime have become more complex, due to rapid advances in technology and the globalization of the financial services industry. Modern financial systems, in addition to facilitating legitimate commerce, permit criminals to order the transfer of millions of dollars instantly, using personal computers and satellite dishes. The criminal's choice of money laundering vehicles is limited only by his or her creativity. Money is laundered through currency exchange houses, stock brokerage houses, gold dealers, casinos, automobile dealerships, insurance companies, and trading companies. Private banking facilities, offshore banking, shell corporations, free trade zones, wire systems, and trade financing all have the ability to mask illegal activities. In doing so, criminals manipulate financial systems in the United States and abroad.

Unchecked, money laundering can erode the integrity of a nation's financial institutions. Due to the high integration of capital markets, money laundering could also adversely affect currencies and interest rates as launderers reinvest funds where their schemes are less likely to be detected, rather than where rates of return are higher.

Ultimately, this laundered money flows into global financial systems where it could undermine national economies and currencies. Money laundering is thus not only a law enforcement problem but poses a serious national and international security threat as well.

There is now worldwide recognition that we must deal firmly and effectively with increasingly elusive, well-financed and technologically adept criminals who are determined to use every means available to subvert the financial systems that are the cornerstone of legitimate international commerce. The continued abuse of some offshore financial centers, the proliferation of on-line Internet banking and Internet gambling have further enhanced the need to scrutinize new technologies to combat money laundering schemes.

Money launderers also negatively impact jurisdictions by reducing tax revenues through underground economies, competing unfairly with legitimate businesses, damaging financial systems, and disrupting economic development. Money laundering is now being viewed as a central dilemma in dealing with all forms of international organized crime because financial gain means power. Fighting money launderers not only reduces financial crime; it also deprives criminals and terrorists of the means to commit other serious crimes.

The United States and other nations are victims of tax evasion schemes that use various financial centers around the world and their bank secrecy laws to hide money from tax authorities, thus undermining legitimate tax collection. Financial centers that have strong bank secrecy laws and weak corporate formation regulations, and that do not cooperate in tax inquiries from foreign governments, are found worldwide. These financial centers, known as ""tax havens,"" thrive in providing sanctuary for the deposit of monies from individuals and businesses that evade the payment of taxes in their home jurisdictions and allow them to keep the money they have deposited from the knowledge of tax authorities. Billions of funds on which tax is properly due, denominated in various currencies, are held on deposit in these tax havens.

Both tax evasion and money laundering are activities that are aided by financial centers that have strong bank secrecy laws and a policy of non-cooperation with foreign law enforcement authorities, as is the case with some jurisdictions with offshore financial centers.

Offshore Financial Centers

Background

Nearly sixty jurisdictions, scattered around the globe, comprise the constantly expanding offshore financial services sector. A recent study found that by the end of 1997, the share of cross-border assets held in the offshore sector ($4.8 trillion) accounted for more than half of all cross-border assets held globally.(1)

(1) Luca Errico and Alberto Musalem, Working paper of the International Monetary Fund, ""Offshore Banking: An Analysis of Micro-and Macro-Prudential Issues"", 1999, p.10.

The attention of many multilateral entities concerned with global financial stability in an increasingly interdependent financial system has been focused on more than just the sheer volume of cross-border assets held by the offshore financial centers (OFCs). While this discussion is not intended to suggest that OFCs, as a class, are all unregulated or all centers of illegal financial activity, the nature of the regulatory and legal regimes in a number of OFCs can be viewed as problematic, as are some of the services and products provided in many OFCs. In particular, the lack of transparency that characterizes many of the OFCs(1) has acted as a powerful magnet attracting governments, groups and individuals desiring to hide their financial activity from public scrutiny.

Although there is little consensus regarding the exact definition of an offshore financial center, certain characteristics distinguish traditional onshore financial centers from those termed ""offshore."" First, offshore financial centers are in almost all cases, segregated from the normal banking structure of the jurisdiction. The vast majority of jurisdictions offering offshore financial services restrict access to these services and products to non-residents, thereby creating a parallel system within their own borders. Many jurisdictions with OFCs conduct financial transactions only in currencies other than the local currency. OFCs also differ from onshore jurisdictions in their regulatory regimes and in their legal frameworks. Many OFCs lack the stringent regulatory and supervisory regimes found in developed onshore jurisdictions. In the majority of OFCs, banks are not required to adhere to a wide range of regulations normally imposed on onshore banks.

Formation of a bank is more easily accomplished in most OFCs; it is even reported that in some jurisdictions a bank can be formed, registered and its ownership placed in the hands of nominee directors via the Internet. However formed, there are few, if any, disclosure requirements; bank transactions are free of exchange and interest rate restrictions; minimal or no capital reserve requirements are required; and transactions are mostly tax-free.

Some 4000 banks are thought to have been licensed and registered globally in the offshore sector by December 1998.(2) How many are merely ""plaque banks,"" (banks without an actual physical presence in the jurisdiction in which they are registered) is not currently known, although the United Nations Global Program Against Money Laundering is currently collecting that data. In many OFCs, non-bank financial industries, such as the insurance and securities industries, are subject to even less, if any, regulation than is the banking industry.

While there are many well-regulated OFCs, a principal attraction is often the existence of legal frameworks designed to obscure the identity of the beneficial owner, to promote regulatory and supervisory arbitrage, and to provide mitigation or evasion of home-country tax regimes. Some of these OFCs offer the ability to form and manage confidentiality of a variety of international business companies (IBCs) and exempt companies, trusts, investment funds and insurance companies, many with nominee directors, nominee officeholders and nominee shareholders. When combined with the use of bearer shares and ""mini-trusts"" (the latter are instruments used to further insulate the beneficial owner while bridging the ownership and management of the corporate entity), IBCs can present impenetrable barriers to law enforcement.(3)

(1) The term ""offshore financial center"" (OFC) is generally thought to describe an entire jurisdiction. However, there are important OFCs located with the borders of jurisdictions. ""OFC"" in this report is used to describe both cases. OFCs maintain that their carefully crafted laws and regulations provide beneficial business and financial planning options for their clients. These include, but are not limited to: sophisticated trade financing; estate planning for high net worth individuals; tax mitigation for individuals and corporations; avoidance of exchange controls; liability containment for ships and airplanes; sophisticated insurance management options; investment opportunities that transcend home country marketing regulations; preservation of assets; investment of overnight funds; and freedom from certain home country regulatory requirements.

(2) Working paper of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, ""The United Nations Forum"", January 2000, p6. Of all offshore banks, 42% are located in the Caribbean and Latin America, 29% in Europe, 19 % in Asia and the Pacific and 10% in Africa and the Middle East.

(3) ""IBC"" is the term used to describe a variety of offshore corporate entities, which are restricted to transacting business outside the jurisdiction in which they are formed. IBCs are characterized by rapid formation, at low cost, with broad powers, low to no taxation, minimal or non-existent reporting requirements and secrecy. Many OFCs permit IBCs to issue bearer shares. The ""UN Offshore Forum"" paper estimated that of the nearly 2.5 million IBCs registered globally, 38% were registered in the Caribbean and Latin America, 25% in Europe, 29% in Asia and the Pacific and 8% in Africa and the Middle East.

This lack of transparency, coupled with a concomitant reluctance or refusal of many OFCs to cooperate with regulators and law enforcement officials from other jurisdictions, attracts those with both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. Drug traffickers, terrorists, money launderers, tax evaders and other criminals have found the OFCs a particularly inviting venue in which to conduct and conceal their activities.

The opacity of many offshores sector makes financial supervision difficult. The Errico and Musalem 1999 working paper of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that the OFCs of Uruguay, Malaysia and Thailand contributed to the recent financial crises of Latin America and Asia by providing a hiding place for losses from loans of the international financial institutions. Another recent study demonstrates how the Russian Central Bank used an IBC formed in the Jersey OFC to mislead the IMF into thinking that Russia's currency reserves were higher than they actually were.(1)

The increased opportunities new technology provides to those who wish to use the offshore sector for criminal purposes have galvanized intensive scrutiny of the offshore sector—generally by a variety of international organizations and multilateral task forces and bodies. Two prominent international bodies, the Financial Stability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force, published reports in 2000 that have already had a dramatic impact on the offshore sector.

Products and Practices

Although IBCs have served as the predominant instruments for committing financial crimes, a variety of types of trusts play important roles as well. One form of trust, the Asset Protection Trust (APT), protects the assets of individuals from civil judgments in their home countries. A common provision of APTs is that challenges or claims against the assets of the trust must be brought before the courts of the jurisdiction of the APT domicile within a relatively short period of time (usually two years). Many APTs contain ""flee clauses"" providing for funds to be immediately transferred to another OFC if the APT is threatened by inquiry. Used in combination, IBCs, mini-trusts, bearer shares and APTs make it nearly impossible for competent authorities to generate paper trails or to identify beneficial owners of companies, while they simultaneously protect those engaging in serious financial crime from civil or criminal prosecution.

Other practices found in some OFCs cause problems for law enforcement. One such practice, well advertised on the Internet, is the selling of ""economic citizenship""—a practice that enables individuals suspected of committing crimes to purchase citizenship in an OFC jurisdiction that does not have an extradition agreement with the purchaser's original home country. Currently five Caribbean Basin OFCs are actively selling economic citizenships: Belize, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts/Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In the Pacific region, economic citizenships are for sale in Nauru.

Internet gaming executed via the use of credit cards and offshore banks represents yet another powerful vehicle for criminals to launder funds from illicit sources as well as to evade taxes. Advertised on the Internet as being located primarily in the Caribbean Basin, virtual casinos can be extremely profitable for governments that sell the licenses and likely share in the operator's profits. By the end of December 2000, Antigua and Barbuda, for example, reportedly had licensed more than 80 Internet gaming websites at a cost of $75,000-$85,000 for a sports betting shop and $100,000 for a virtual casino. As the Offshore Financial Services chart indicates, with the exception of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, all Caribbean Basin OFCs that sell ""economic citizenships"" also sell virtual casino licenses. In the Pacific region, only the Palau and Vanuatu OFCs are reported to sell gaming licenses (reportedly for much lower fees than are charged in the Caribbean). Neither Palau nor Vanuatu sell economic citizenships.(2)

(1) Errico and Musalem analyze the role of the OFCs in the Asian and Latin American crises, pp. 37-38. The PricewaterhouseCoopers, ""Report to V.V. Gerashenko, Central Bank of Russia, re: FIMACO"", August 1999. Commissioned by the IMF, the report leads to the conclusion that the Russian Central Bank used FIMACO (the Jersey registered IBC) to anonymously purchase Russian government debt.

(2) See the Offshore Financial Services Chart at the end of this section.

With the advent of the Internet and other technological advances, monies can be quickly transferred around the globe, providing further opportunities to engage in the placement and layering of illicitly gained funds. There is a growing concern that criminals are increasingly enlisting the services of unethical lawyers, accountants and other professionals to help them discover and manipulate new money laundering opportunities afforded by the new technologies.

Initiatives Targeting Financial Abuse

In recent years, various bodies have examined the threats presented by a lack of transparency and oversight posed to an increasingly interdependent global financial system. Two initiatives, The Financial Stability Forum's Offshore Working Group and the Financial Action Task Force's Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories Initiative, have had a direct impact on the offshore financial services industry in 2000. These initiatives have drawn distinctions between the better-regulated and cooperative jurisdictions and those that are not. Both initiatives have focused a great deal of attention on the OFCs although the FATF initiative addresses jurisdictions beyond OFCs.

The Financial Stability Forum Working Group on Offshore Financial Centers

The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) was convened in 1999 at the request of the G-7 Finance Ministers to promote international financial stability through information exchange and international cooperation in financial supervision and surveillance. At its first meeting in April 1999, the FSF established the Working Group on Offshore Financial Centers. The working group was comprised of officials of industrial and emerging market economies, international institutions and international regulatory and supervisory groupings.

The FSF Working Group's mandate was to consider the significance of OFCs in relation to global financial stability. In April, the FSF Working Group issued a report concluding that a number of the OFCs were perceived as having weaknesses in financial supervision, cross-border cooperation and transparency. In order to prioritize the jurisdictions for eventual IMF assessment, OFCs were divided into three categories: Group I (cooperative OFCs with high quality supervision), Group II (potentially cooperative OFCs with low quality supervision) and Group III (non-cooperative OFCs with low quality supervision).

The OFCs in Group I, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Singapore and Switzerland, were ""generally perceived as having legal infrastructures and supervisory practices, and/or a level of resources devoted to supervision and co-operation relative to the size of their financial activities, and/or a level of cooperation that are largely of a good quality and better than in other OFCs."" The OFCs of Guernsey, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey were also generally viewed in the same light ""though continuing efforts to improve the quality of supervision and co-operation should be encouraged in these jurisdictions.'' (1)

(1) Financial Stability Forum press release, May 26, 2000. The Report of the Working Group on Offshore Financial Centers is located at the FSF's website: http://www.fsforum.org.

OFCs in Group II (Andorra, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, Gibraltar, Labuan (Malaysia), Macao, Malta and Monaco) were considered to be of lower quality than Group I but higher than the OFCs in Group III.

OFCs listed in Group III were Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Nauru, Netherlands Antilles, Niue, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Vanuatu. These jurisdictions were generally perceived as having legal infrastructures and supervisory practices, and/or level of resources devoted to supervision and co-operation relative to the size of their activity, and/or level of co-operation that are largely of a lower quality than in Group II.

The report concluded that the perceived deficiencies in Groups II and III OFCs could allow financial market participants to engage in regulatory arbitrage of several forms, thereby undermining efforts to strengthen the global financial system. As a result, the FSF in May released the groupings of the OFCs by category, requesting that the IMF develop, organize and conduct assessments of OFC adherence to international financial standards, including several of the FATF 40 Recommendations. The FSF recommended giving ""highest priority to those in Group II"" and ""high priority to those OFCs in Group III whose scale of financial activity has the greatest potential impact on global financial stability.""

The IMF agreed in July to a program that contemplates three levels of assessment that review principally the supervisory and regulatory arrangements in place for banking, securities and insurance activities. The first level is a self-assessment, the second is an assessment led by the IMF and the third, a more complex assessment, will also be led by the IMF. Participation in the program is voluntary and no IMF assessment will be made public unless the assessed jurisdiction voluntarily agrees to its release(1)

In response to the G-7 Finance Ministers 1998 Birmingham Summit, the FATF formally created the Ad Hoc Group on Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT.) In 1999, this group developed twenty-five criteria for the purpose of determining which jurisdictions weakened the global effort to combat money laundering. These criteria encompass four broad areas:

Loopholes in financial regulations
Obstacles raised by other regulatory requirements
Obstacles to international cooperation
Inadequate resources for preventing and detecting money laundering activities

FATF initiated a review of a first tranche of jurisdictions in February 2000. After a through review and dialogue with these jurisdictions, the FATF at its June 2000 Plenary identified fifteen jurisdictions as non-cooperative in the international fight against money laundering. Those fifteen were as follows: the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Dominica, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Panama, the Philippines, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All but Israel, Lebanon and Russia are OFCs.

Fourteen other jurisdictions, all OFCs, were identified as having deficiencies, but were not placed on the non-cooperative list. Those jurisdictions are as follows: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Samoa and St. Lucia. The reviews of two other OFC jurisdictions, Vanuatu and the Seychelles, were not completed at the June Plenary, but at the October Plenary neither jurisdiction was determined to be non-cooperative.

At the July G-7 Finance Ministers Summit held in Japan, the United States along with its partners, issued formal advisories or notices notifying all financial institutions in G-7 countries of the FATF's issuance of Recommendation 21.(2) The U.S. Department of Treasury issued individual advisories regarding each of the fifteen named NCCTs to all U.S. financial institutions. The advisories advised financial institutions to ""give enhanced scrutiny"" to transactions involving the named jurisdictions.

(1) The report, Offshore Financial Centers, The Role of the IMF, can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/2000/nb0062.htm.

(2) FATF Recommendation 21 states: Financial institutions should give special attention to business relations and transactions with persons, including companies and financial institutions, from countries which do not or insufficiently apply these Recommendations. Whenever these transactions have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose, their background and purpose should, as far as possible, be examined, the findings established in writing, and be available to help supervisors, auditors and law enforcement agencies.

The FATF's NCCT exercise, while not designed to focus on OFCs, has had a significant impact on the OFCs and other jurisdictions around the globe. For more information on this initiative see the discussion of the NCCT process in the Multilateral Section—FATF overview—in this report.

Explanatory Notes To the Offshore Financial Services Chart

Public information regarding offshore financial centers can be difficult to obtain. Industry publications, discussions with regulators of the OFCs, foreign government finance officials, embassy reports, analyses from United States Government (USG) agencies, international organizations, and secondary sources provided the data for the chart.

Excluded are jurisdictions that provide low or no taxes to individuals but offer no other services or products normally associated with the offshore financial service sector. Also excluded are jurisdictions that have established OFCs but for which the USG has little or no information regarding the operations of the OFC. Within most categories presented on the chart, the designations Y and N are used to denote the existence (Y) or the non-existence (N) of the entity or service in a specific jurisdiction. Where there is no (or only fragmentary) information regarding specific categories, the corresponding cells on the chart are left blank. In some categories, symbols other than or in addition to Y or N are used. Explanations for additional symbols are provided below.

Explanations of the categories themselves are either provided in the preceding text, are considered to be self-evident, or are provided below.

Money Laundering Trends and Typologies

As in previous years, money launderers have demonstrated a great deal of creativity in combining traditional money laundering techniques into complex money laundering schemes designed to thwart the ability of authorities to prevent, detect and prosecute money laundering. Increasingly, however, money launderers are modifying traditional techniques to take advantage of developments and technologies designed to streamline the process as well as employing the services of professionals such as lawyers and accountants to help launder illicit proceeds. Below are some examples of various money laundering typologies and a review of statistical information on U.S. money laundering trends for 2000.

Statistical Overview of U.S. Money Laundering Trends

Suspicious Activity Reporting: Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) continue to play a critical role in U.S. anti-money laundering efforts. Similar types of reporting systems are in operation throughout the world and are a key component in global anti-money laundering efforts as well. In addition to their importance to law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering, SAR reporting can also provide important information on current money laundering trends and typologies. This information can then be used by authorities to develop more effective countermeasures. The following statistical overview is derived from aggregate totals for Suspicious Activity Reports filed by depository institutions (i.e., banks, thrifts and credit unions) from the U.S. SAR system. A small part of the total volume relates to reports filed by affiliates of depository institutions or, in some cases, filed voluntarily by brokers and dealers in securities, money service businesses, or gaming businesses.

Developments in Analyzing U.S. National SAR Data

The size of the U.S. national SAR database presents special opportunities for developing analytic approaches to the data set. Analysis of the data set has enabled FinCEN to provide banks with important feedback regarding examples and patterns of suspicious activity.

Money Laundering Trends in 2000

Wire Transfers and Shell Company Activity

SARs filed during the first half of 2000 reflect several complex activities involving suspicious wire transfer patterns. As reported in the SAR narratives, many of these suspicious wire transfer patterns involve shell companies— i.e., corporations that engage in no apparent business activity and that only serve as a conduit for funds or securities. Often the activities also involve foreign transactors located in jurisdictions considered non-cooperative in the fight against global money laundering.

Several complex suspicious wire transfer transactions have been observed, each involving geographically complicated wire transfer routing (originator, beneficiary, or transit/intermediary banks) and/or geographically complex originator and beneficiary activity. More than $500 million in suspicious wire transfers have been reported in connection with this type of activity.

These activities display common patterns of underlying suspicious activity:

A lack of evidence of legitimate business activity, or any business operations undertaken by many of the companies;
Unusually large numbers of wire transfers (several thousand wires totaling more than U.S. $500 million);
Transactions conducted in bursts of activities within a short period of time;
Beneficiaries maintaining accounts at foreign banks that have been the subject of previous SAR reporting due to suspicious wire transfer activity;
Reappearing beneficiary banks based in offshore locations, the account of at least one of which has been closed by the reporting financial institution due to overall suspect activity.

Increased SAR Reporting Involving Mexico

Law enforcement information and SARs filed by U.S. financial institutions confirm a shift in suspected money laundering activity involving Mexico. Rather than transiting through Mexico en route to Colombia or other Central and South American destinations, often drug proceeds are now cycled through Mexico directly back into the United States. SARs have revealed patterns of large wire transactions ($1.5 million or more per transaction) moving funds to U.S. payees from Mexican money exchange houses and other financial institutions, which may at least, in part, be attributable to changes in the laundering cycle. Such changes in patterns are believed to stem from the heightened profile of Mexico-based criminal groups in drug trafficking in the U.S., which creates a corresponding increased threat of money laundering activity linked to Mexico.

Money Remitter Activity

The 2000 National Money Laundering Financial Sector Strategy Conference, co-sponsored by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Justice, provided a forum for discussing recently observed trends pertaining to the use of money remitters for illicit funds transfer and money laundering.

There was a general consensus among the conference participants that there are three major categories of remitters currently operating: a) money remitters that are corrupt and are working directly with the money launderers and drug dealers; b) money remitters that might not be directly involved with the illicit proceeds, but are ""willfully blind"" to these activities and transactions; and c) money remitters that are not necessarily aware of nor ""willfully blind"" to the illicit activities.

Various schemes appear primarily designed to evade federal and industry practice that is mandated by record keeping, reporting, and customer identification requirements. These varied activities include basic structuring of money transfer transactions below the reporting and identification dollar amount thresholds mandated by government; the use of multiple money transfer agent businesses and/or parent remitter companies to avoid overall monitoring and detection by the industry(1); and frequent use of falsified names, addresses, and receipts as a ""cover"" justification for the substantial illicit funds transfers.

(1) As DEA also points out, ""In some cases, the agent (business) may represent a variety of remittance companies. When this is the case, the agent may suggest dividing the deposit, sending a portion with each of the represented businesses (companies). Thus, detection is increasingly challenging.""

Federal authorities at the conference also highlighted the recent growth of smaller independent remitters (beyond the more established Western Union and MoneyGram systems), particularly of those providing service to and from Mexico. DEA reported that although these remitters provide important legitimate services to migrant worker populations, the location of these businesses, ""do not necessarily parallel the employment centers for these laborers. Rather, it appears that the agent locations are primarily located in states without regulations governing the money services industry.""

Update on Suspicious Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Activity

Analysis of SAR reporting on ATM transactions confirms a continuing trend in suspicious transactions in which funds are wired to/through a U.S. financial institution from a foreign source and then withdrawn in cash in a third country using ATMs. SARs indicate such ATM withdrawals in at least 57 nations, with the highest incidence in Colombia (408 occurrences), followed by Venezuela (145), Mexico (119), and Argentina (31). The wire transfers that start the cycle originate primarily in Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and England. Amounts up to several hundred thousand dollars have been withdrawn over several months using this method.

Other Money Laundering Trends and Typologies

Black Market Peso Exchange System

The Black Market Peso Exchange System (BMPE) is a trade-based system that depends on commercial traffic between the U.S. and Colombia to launder profits from the sale of illegal drugs in the United States. The BMPE is a significant money laundering conduit used by Colombian narcotics traffickers in repatriating revenues to Colombia. The process begins when a Colombian drug organization arranges the shipment of drugs to the United States. The drugs are sold in the U.S. in exchange for U.S. currency that is then sold to a Colombian black market peso broker's agent in the United States. The U.S. currency is sold at a discount because the broker and his agent must assume the risk of evading the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements when later placing the dollars into the U.S. financial system.

Once the dollars are delivered to the U.S.-based agent of the peso broker, the peso broker in Colombia deposits the agreed upon equivalent in Colombian pesos into the organization's account in Colombia. At this point, the organization has laundered its money because it has successfully converted its drug dollars into pesos, and the Colombian broker and his agent now assume the risk for introducing the laundered drug dollars into the U.S. banking system, usually through a variety of surreptitious transactions. Having introduced the dollars into the U.S. banking system, the Colombian black market peso broker now has a pool of laundered dollars to sell to Colombian importers. These importers then use the dollars to purchase goods, either from the U.S. or from other markets, which are transported to Colombia, often via smuggling in order to avoid applicable Colombian law.

The exact size and structure of the BMPE system cannot be determined with any degree of precision. However, based on anecdotal law enforcement evidence, informants' statements, and Colombian law enforcement and intelligence officials, it is believed that between $3 billion and $6 billion is laundered annually. Other sources of demand for BMPE dollars include capital outflows by Colombian residents, who seek either to conceal the funds from the Colombian authorities or simply to take advantage of the favorable BMPE exchange rate.

To combat the BMPE, the U.S. Department of Treasury has instituted an interagency working group that has aggressively attacked this problem and whose efforts have resulted in better coordinated and integrated anti-BMPE investigations and increased successful prosecutions. Treasury's outreach programs to educate U.S. exporters of the operations of and their vulnerability to the BMPE have also achieved success. During the past year, high level U.S. Government officials met with senior officials of U.S. companies whose products are vulnerable to the BMPE to explain the system and to encourage them to develop programs to counter the BMPE.

In addition to these domestic outreach efforts, the United States, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela and Aruba have formed an international working group of experts to combat this money laundering system. This working group is to study the BMPE, report its findings, and recommend policy options and actions that can be taken by the governments against the BMPE.

On October 21, 2000, a task force composed of U.S. Treasury Department and Department of Justice officials and government officials from Aruba, Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela participated in the first meeting of this working group. At the meeting, the 30 experts discussed how the BMPE money laundering system affected each of their respective countries. Topics of discussion included the BMPE steps, documentation of international commercial transactions, the problems with existing paper trails and laws, and ways to improve international cooperation. The group's work is planned to continue in meetings to be held in Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela during the course of 2001.

The Hawala System

The hawala (or hundi) alternative (or parallel) remittance system continues to be a key factor in money laundering and other financial crimes committed in and associated with South Asia. It is closely related to the ""black"" or ""off the books"" economies in the region. The size of the underground economies in South Asia are estimated to be 50 to 100 percent the size of the ""white"" or ""documented"" economies.

Hawala operates on trust and connections (""trust"" is one of several meanings associated with the word ""hawala""). Customers trust hawala ""bankers"" or ""operators"" (known as hawaladars) who use their connections to facilitate money movement worldwide. Hawala transfers take place with little, if any, paper trail; and, when records are kept, they are usually kept in code. Contrary to various media reports, hawala is an ancient system; it was the primary money transfer mechanism used in South Asia prior to the introduction of Western banking. Today, hawala continues to be used for many legitimate transfers for cultural and financial reasons; and it also often operates in conjunction with Western banking operations.

Dubai, India and Pakistan form a ""hawala triangle"" responsible for significant international money laundering activities that go far beyond South Asia. While interdiction of non-bank money laundering systems, such as hawala, is difficult enough in itself, this difficulty is sometimes compounded by ineffective money laundering countermeasures in Dubai and the other Emirates.

Internet Gambling

Internet gambling is illegal in the United States. A joint FBI-IRS Internet gambling investigation recently targeted a Sports Tout Service (STC) which was providing its services via the Internet, as well as functioning as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The STC service collected, collated and analyzed statistical and other information relative to sporting events, and then in turn sold this information to subscribers who factored it into their betting decisions. The STC/ISP also included two offshore gambling operations located in the Caribbean, both of which accepted wagers via the Internet or toll-free telephone numbers. Law enforcement personnel were successful in infiltrating the operation.

To launder the proceeds from their illegal Internet gambling activities, the subjects of this investigation employed the services of an attorney. The attorney devised an elaborate scheme in which the STC/ISP leased its services to the subjects of the investigation for a specified amount. Proceeds were also laundered through a series of bank accounts in the Caribbean and eventually funneled back to U.S. banking institutions. Investigators estimate that approximately $178 million was wagered through the STC/ISP annually. It is anticipated that subjects in this investigation will be charged with gambling, money laundering, tax evasion and RICO-related offenses.

Lawyers/Notaries, Accountants and Other Non-Financial Professionals

United States law enforcement authorities have observed that as money laundering schemes become more complex, the perpetrators turn to the learned expertise of attorneys, accountants, consultants and agent representatives to aid them in the movement of illegal currency. These professionals, using shell corporations, nominees and fictitious records, devise elaborate paper trails to disguise the true source of illegal income. During Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, 131 attorneys, accountants and consultants were sentenced as a result of money laundering convictions.

The Market for Gold and other Precious Metals

Gold is known to play a significant role in international money laundering. Gold, just like certain currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, and British pound, the Euro) is a nearly universal commodity for international commerce. The attractiveness and value of a particular currency depend on a complex and often unstable variety of political and economic conditions. Gold has been a key medium of exchange since antiquity and will, in fact, most likely always enjoy this position, as it appears nearly immune to the consequences of changing global fortunes.

Gold serves as both a commodity and, to a lesser extent, a medium of exchange in money laundering conducted in Latin America, the United States, Europe and Asia. In this cycle, for example, gold bullion makes its way to Italy via Swiss brokers. There it is made into jewelry, much of which is then shipped to Latin America. In Latin America, this jewelry (or the raw gold from which it was made) then becomes one, if not the most important, of the commodities in the black market peso exchange.

In a recent case, United States law enforcement authorities identified a money laundering system that makes use of the legitimate gold trade to launder money through black market currency exchanges. In this system, gold jewelry is sold in the Panama Colon Free Trade Zone to Colombians (who are allegedly hoarding gold against the devaluation of the peso). The jewelry is smuggled into Colombia through the city of Bucaramanga. The jewelry is then melted and formed to resemble gold from mines, fabricated into pigment and then shipped to the U.S. for refining. (The pigment fabrication stage is important because the Colombian government will pay a 4.5 percent export tax credit on the exported goods.) The ""gold pigment"" arrives in the U.S. but is instead entered as ""bullion"", which does not qualify for the export credit. The gold is refined and sold in the U.S. and then smuggled back to South America. The resulting loss to the Colombian government is estimated to be over $20 million. A variant of this scheme has the refined gold being exported to Switzerland for sale to Italian jewelry manufacturers for delivery to Panama. In all cases, it is believed that the same gold is being recycled throughout each step of the scheme.

Structured Postal Money Orders—Alien Smuggling Proceeds

An anti-smuggling task force consisting of U.S. Postal Inspectors and special agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Internal Revenue Service executed a federal warrant at the Bank of America in New York City to seize the contents of an account (totaling roughly $230,000) maintained by an international exchange firm located in the United Arab Emirates. The investigation indicated that the account contained alien smuggling proceeds, in the form of structured postal money orders and other monetary instruments. These proceeds were being moved through the exchange company's account to members of alien smuggling organizations in India and, as reimbursement for smuggling fees, to relatives in India who helped with the operation.

Structured Postal Money Orders—Illicit Drug Proceeds

A multi-agency task force consisting of U.S. Postal Inspectors from the North Jersey/Caribbean Division and special agents from the Internal Revenue Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs Service arrested nine members of a narcotics and money laundering ring known as the ""Dussan Organization."" The ring operated in Northern New Jersey, New York and Colombia and was charged with money laundering and structuring transactions to avoid currency transaction reporting requirements. Members of the group allegedly structured postal and commercial money orders at various post offices and convenience stores in New Jersey and New York, and used express mail services to send the money orders to various businesses in the United States and South America. It is estimated that the ring laundered at least $3 million in illegal proceeds.

Suspicious Financial Activity in Casinos

A review of SARs filed by gaming establishments reveals patterns of suspicious activity in which casino accounts are used to transfer significant amounts of funds through non-bank financial transaction channels. The funds are cashed out by the client or moved to other accounts with minimal or no gaming activity. Variations on this theme involved an initial deposit by wire or bank cashiers check, but then the funds would be wired out to another account. The funds were then stored for a period of time in a casino safety deposit box or held in the form of safekeeping markers, and then cashed out. In several instances the client was observed transferring chips to other individuals to cash out, as well as cashing out a greater amount than held on deposit (with no gambling winnings to account for the excess amount).

Trusts, Other Non-Corporate Entities and Money Laundering

One multi-agency task force investigation focused on a scheme where an investment consultant had formed a management group under the laws of Anguilla and offered investment services to citizens of the United States. A confidential informant (CI), cooperating with law enforcement, advised the offshore consultant of the CI's desire to launder drug proceeds. The consultant offered to set up an off shore trust for the CI and withhold the CI's identity from the trust records, thereby distorting the true illegal source of the funds.

Due to the U.S. Customs Service requirement of filing an International Transportation of Currency Report, the consultant required delivery of the funds by a courier to an international airport in Canada before the consultant actually took possession of the funds. In Toronto, Canada the consultant took delivery of $100,000 in unsigned traveler checks, promising to deposit the checks in Caribbean bank accounts and to wire transfer the money back to the CI, less commissions. The consultant then traveled to St. Maarten and Anguilla and established the promised accounts. These accounts were opened at Barclays Bank, Anguilla and Chase Manhattan, St. Maarten. The funds were then wire transmitted back to the U.S.

Upon his return to the United States, the subject was arrested. The subject was indicted on six counts of money laundering and Customs violations. Through plea negotiations, the subject received 18 months incarceration.

U.S. Money Laundering Countermeasures

National Money Laundering Strategy

On October 15, 1998, Congress passed the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998. The Act called upon the President, acting through the Secretary of the Treasury and in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop a national strategy for combating money laundering and related financial crimes. The Act called for the first national strategy to be sent to Congress in 1999, and updated annually for the following four consecutive years. The first annual strategy was released on September 23, 1999. The National Money Laundering Strategy for 2000 was released on March 8, 2000, at a press conference co-chaired by the Deputy Attorney General and Deputy Treasury Secretary.

The 2000 Strategy is organized according to the four following overarching goals: (1) to strengthen domestic enforcement in order to disrupt the flow of illegal money; (2) to enhance regulatory and cooperative public-private efforts to prevent money laundering; (3) to strengthen partnerships with state and local governments to fight money laundering throughout the United States; and (4) to strengthen international cooperation in order to disrupt the global flow of illicit money.

These four goals are supported by identified objectives which, in turn, are to be accomplished through approximately 65 specific action items set out in the strategy.

Significant Action Items

The following are summaries of the most significant action items:

Designation of High Intensity Financial Crime Areas (HIFCAs): The designation of HIFCAs was mandated by the 1998 legislation and was the first action item in the 1999 Strategy. HIFCAs are defined as special, high-risk areas or sectors where law enforcement will concentrate its resources and energy to combat money laundering. The Justice and Treasury Departments led a process to identify and designate the first HIFCAs. As part of this process, the two departments convened an interagency HIFCA Working Group to collect and analyze relevant information and make recommendations to the Deputy Attorney General and the Deputy Treasury Secretary for the HIFCA designations. The 2000 Strategy designated the first HIFCAs: (1) New York City/Northern New Jersey area; (2) the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area; (3) San Juan, Puerto Rico; and (4) a ""systems"" HIFCA to focus and enhance current efforts addressing the problem of cross-border currency smuggling/movements between Mexico and Texas and Arizona. The HIFCA program is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to combat money laundering in the designated high-intensity money laundering zones. Future HIFCAs will be selected from applications received from prospective areas or from candidates proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General.
Financial Crime-Free Communities Support Program: The 2000 Strategy announces the launching of the Financial Crime-Free Communities Support (C-FIC) program. The C-FIC program is also the result of a legislative mandate which calls for the establishment of a federal grant program to provide seed capital for emerging state and local anti-money laundering enforcement efforts. The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) is assisting the Treasury Department in administering this grant program. Congress appropriated $2.9 million in fiscal year 2000 for the commencement of the program. The first nine recipients for C-FIC grants were announced in September 2000 and included a variety of programs proposed by state and local law enforcement agencies in New York, Illinois, Arizona, Florida, Texas and California.
Money Service Business Suspicious Activity Report Reporting: In conjunction with the release of the strategy, the Treasury Department announced the issuance of final regulations, effective December 31, 2001, mandating that money transmitters, issuers, sellers, and redeemers of money orders and traveler's checks must report suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department.
Financial Crime Havens: The 1999 Strategy called for the formation of an interagency working group to explore whether measures should be adopted to restrict financial institutions in the United States from opening or maintaining correspondent banking accounts for foreign banks that are organized in ""lax"" offshore jurisdictions. This initiative was pursued in conjunction with the FATF NCCT initiative which resulted in the naming of fifteen Non-cooperative Countries and Jurisdictions in June 2000. The issuance of this list was followed by the issuance of FinCEN Advisories to United States financial institutions concerning the fifteen designated jurisdictions.
"" Gatekeepers"": Pursuant to the 1999 Strategy, an interagency working group was created to examine the responsibilities of professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, with regard to money laundering. The 2000 Strategy directed the working group to continue its review and ""to make recommendations—ranging from enhanced professional education, standards or rules, to legislation—as might be needed."" In April 2000, a meeting of representatives from the G-8 countries was convened in Washington, D.C. to discuss this issue. Because of the difficult legal and policy issues involved when considering the responsibilities of lawyers and accountants in this area, the working group is continuing to study this issue and prepare recommendations for the Steering Committee in 2001.
Legislation: The Treasury Department announced that in conjunction with the 2000 Strategy, the administration was sending new anti-money laundering legislation to Congress. The International Counter-Money Laundering Act of 2000 offered needed new authority to take calibrated action against foreign financial crime havens. In addition to seeking enactment of the Treasury bill, the 2000 Strategy called for the administration to seek enactment of the Justice Department's Money Laundering Act of 2000, which was submitted to Congress on November 10, 1999. This bill contained numerous provisions that would enhance the effectiveness of the money laundering statutes. However, neither of these bills was enacted in 2000.

In conjunction with the announcement of the 2000 Strategy, on March 7, 2000, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury issued a joint memorandum to all U.S. Attorneys (USAs) and the heads of all of the federal law enforcement agencies emphasizing the importance of anti-money laundering enforcement. In addition it requested the implementation of several action items recommended in the 1999 Strategy.

Specifically, the memorandum urged the USAs and the law enforcement agencies:

to encourage below-threshold investigations and prosecutions that potentially have a systemic or financial sector-wide effect on money laundering;
to establish SAR review teams;
to ensure that all informants and cooperating witnesses are debriefed with respect to money laundering methods and their knowledge of money laundering techniques;
to increase the use of electronic surveillance in appropriate money laundering cases;
to enhance the support and analysis of multi-district money laundering investigations;
to increase training for financial investigations; and
to increase the strategic use of asset forfeiture in money laundering cases.

The 2000 Strategy set out a far-reaching and highly ambitious regimen of action items and milestones to be addressed and accomplished during 2000. The implementation of the Money Laundering Strategy is being guided by an interagency Steering Committee co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and the Deputy Attorney General, with the participation of relevant departments and agencies. The Steering Committee has the responsibility of tracking and identifying progress toward fulfillment of the goals and objectives identified in the 2000 Strategy and this progress will be reported in the 2001 Strategy.

Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) - 42

At the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1995, the President of the United States broadened the definition of what constitutes a national security threat to include international crime. Shortly thereafter, in October of that year, PDD-42 was signed, directing a cooperative federal effort against international criminal organizations and money laundering. The U.S. Departments of Justice, State and the Treasury as well as the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Security Council, intelligence agencies and other federal entities were instructed to work together to confront and counter this threat to U.S. national security and international stability.

PDD-42 directs the agencies to cooperate to accomplish the following objectives: (1) produce greater results in this area by increasing the priority and resources devoted to this effort; (2) achieve increased effectiveness and synergy by improving coordination among agencies and across the types of international criminal activity; (3) assist and work more closely with other governments to create a global response and to eliminate this threat and to eliminate sanctuaries; and (4) use creatively and aggressively all legal means available to the government to combat international organized crime.

The year 2000 saw progress on all of these fronts with notable success achieved in developing a global response identifying money laundering vulnerabilities and encouraging compliance with international anti-money laundering standards. A United States interagency group worked with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in its groundbreaking effort to name non-cooperative countries and territories in the fight against money laundering. As noted previously in this report, the FATF developed a set of twenty-five criteria to be used in determining whether a jurisdiction had an acceptable or deficient anti-money laundering regime and issued a report listing fifteen jurisdictions as having serious deficiencies.

The FATF non-cooperative countries and territories exercise encompasses some of the essential tenets of PDD-42. It has brought together the 29 FATF member nations in a multilateral effort to not only define what makes a country vulnerable to money laundering but to then clearly identify those nations whose substandard anti-money laundering regimes attract illegal proceeds that underwrite international criminal activity. The United States, in making its contribution to FATF, draws upon the collective expertise of the federal interagency community. That community has played a vital role by assessing the money laundering threat in various regions, analyzing the shortcomings in existing national laws, regulations and practices, crafting countermeasures and providing training and technical assistance to identified jurisdictions making a conscientious effort at improvement. During 2000, this integrated federal effort in support of the FATF initiative on non-cooperative jurisdictions has focused international attention and brought unprecedented progress in dealing with the global challenge of money laundering.

Another key component of the International Crime Control Strategy and PDD-42 has been the imposition of sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The U.S. now has at its disposal two powerful economic sanctions options against narcotics traffickers, the entities they own or control, and those persons acting for them or supporting their narcotics trafficking activities.

In addition to IEEPA, the U.S. Government also is using the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (""the Kingpin Designation Act""). In December of 1999, the President signed into law the Kingpin Designation Act, which provides him with a statutory framework for imposing sanctions against foreign drug kingpins when such sanctions are appropriate. Twelve foreign persons were identified as appropriate for sanctions on June 1, 2000 and others will be designated by June 1, 2001. Of those twelve foreign persons, six were from Mexico (Benjamin Alberto Arellano Felix, Ramon Eduardo Arellano Felix, Jose de Jesus Amezcua Contreras, Luis Ignacio Amezcua Contreras, Rafael Caro Quintero, Vicente Carrillo Fuentes), two were from the Caribbean (Noel Timothy Heath, Glenroy Vingrove Matthews), two were from Nigeria (Abeni O. Ogungbuyi, Oluwole A. Ogungbuyi) and two were from Asia (Chang Chi Fu, Wei Hsueh Kang).

The Kingpin Designation Act is modeled after the highly effective Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (""SDNT"") program that Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") administers against the Colombian cartels pursuant to Executive order 12978, which was issued in October 1995 under the authority of IEEPA. Nearly 600 individuals and entities have been identified as SDNTs since the Colombia program's inception.

Both the Kingpin Designation Act and the IEEPA-SDNT program prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions, trade and services involving foreign narcotics kingpins and derivative designees. The objective of both laws is to deny drug kingpins, their businesses and their agents access to the U.S. financial system and to the benefits of trade and transactions involving U.S. businesses and individuals. The long-term effectiveness of designations under the Kingpin Designation Act, as well as designations under an IEEPA program, depends heavily upon Treasury's authority to make derivative designations of entities and individuals, as is being done in the IEEPA-SDNT program against Colombian cartels.

The Kingpin Designation Act moves beyond the IEEPA-SDNT Colombia model to target the activities of significant foreign narcotics traffickers (""drug kingpins"") and their organizations on a worldwide basis. In keeping with PDD-42's emphasis on interagency cooperation, the Kingpin Designation Act requires that the Departments of Treasury, Justice, State, and Defense and the CIA coordinate to develop a list of recommended kingpins for presidential designation by June 1 of each year. The statute permits kingpin designations at other times as well.

In accordance with PDD-42's emphasis on international cooperation and collaborations, to the extent feasible, the United States will continue to coordinate carefully with host governments concerning drug kingpins. Furthermore, the United States will continue to work cooperatively with appropriate host government authorities to pursue additional measures and leads against those significant foreign narcotics traffickers. An example of the importance of this cooperation has been the success the Government of Colombia has had in applying the IEEPA-SDNT program against narcotics cartels in that country.

Enforcement Cases

Attorney/Accountant Case

This case involved 19 individuals in the Home Health Care service, one being both an attorney and accountant. This indictment contained 123 counts involving conspiracy, false claims, wire fraud and money laundering. The false claims involved fictitious patient claims and claims for services which were not provided.

The two primary subjects employed an attorney to incorporate four interrelated shell corporations as the controlling entities. In addition, eight nominee corporations were created to generate fictitious health care service records reflecting in-home therapy and nursing care. Health care providers including therapists, registered nurses and physicians operated the nominee corporations. To keep the health care billing, tax return filings and bank account records synchronized, the two main subjects relied on the attorney/accountant defendant.

In excess of $4 million was laundered through bank accounts in New York, Florida and suspected offshore accounts in connection with this scheme. Numerous accounts were created at four or five separate banks for purposes of amassing and moving these funds. Cashier's checks often were purchased and even negotiated through the attorney/accountant's trust account to conceal property acquisition. This defendant was sentenced to two years in jail.

Both primary defendants were ordered to forfeit real and personal property, including the $4 million and purchased property. They received five- and two-year prison sentences respectively. Two related case defendants laundered an additional $2 million and were charged in a separate 33 count indictment. They were ordered to forfeit $95,000 in currency.

Colombian Money Laundering Operation

The Department of Justice announced in November 2000 that Jose Stroh, of Cali, Colombia, pled guilty to conspiring to launder in excess of $129 million of narcotics proceeds for various drug cartels in Colombia between 1986 and 1992.

Stroh, a fugitive Colombian national, was apprehended by the DEA in early February 2000 while attempting to pass through Panamanian customs. He was transported to Miami and eventually Connecticut to face charges.

Stroh was charged with operating a money laundering enterprise which was responsible for turning millions of dollars of proceeds generated from cocaine sales in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Mexico into Colombian pesos which he returned to the Cali narcotics traffickers.

Stroh, operating from Colombia, opened bank accounts in Panama into which the drug proceeds were delivered in the form of money orders, checks and wire transfers. Cash was transferred in suitcases, boxes, bags, and other containers. Money launderers then would convert the cash to checks or deposit it into accounts where it could be transferred anywhere in the world. Some of these funds were wired to bank accounts in Israel and Germany where the laundered funds were subsequently moved to one of two Panamanian shell corporations that Stroh controlled. Often times, the money orders were concealed inside of magazines and shipped out of the U.S. through various courier services in New Jersey to Stroh's businesses in Panama.

At the same time Stroh was negotiating with Cali Cartel intermediaries for the purchase of dollars in the United States, he was also negotiating with others for the sale of these dollars in exchange for Colombian pesos. Stroh often sold dollars to ""legitimate"" businesses in Colombia that needed dollars for transactions in the United States.

Stroh is scheduled for sentencing in February 2001. He faces a maximum term of imprisonment of five years, and $5,000,000 in fines. As part of his agreement with the Government, Stroh agreed to relinquish $930,000 in several accounts that he held at Lehman Brothers brokerage house in Miami, Florida.

Dinero Express

Dinero Express Inc. is a Dominican money remitter licensed in the states of New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Florida, and Puerto Rico. In August 1996, three Dinero Express employees were arrested and pled guilty to money laundering violations. In addition to these arrests, two search warrants were executed on Dinero Express locations. Analysis of the search warrant documents, as well as documents provided by a cooperating defendant, revealed a money laundering operation, responsible for the laundering of approximately $10.1 million in criminally derived proceeds through an elaborate structuring scheme.

On April 18, 2000, at the conclusion of a 7 year investigation, a Federal Grand Jury empanelled within the Southern District of New York, issued an indictment charging Dinero Express Inc., and its President, Roberto Beras with 82 counts of money laundering and currency reporting violations. The indictment went on to charge Luis Francisco Soriano, a manager of Dinero Express, with 4 counts of money laundering and currency reporting violations, as well as Maria Mendoza, clerk of Dinero Express, who was charged with 35 counts of currency reporting violations.

On December 5, 2000, the Jury ordered forfeiture of $10 million against Dinero Express Inc. and Roberto Beras.

Operation Cashback Nets 60 Individuals

Operation Cashback is one of the largest investigations of the Black Market Peso Exchange System (BMPE) ever undertaken by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It culminated with the indictment of 60 individuals for money laundering in the Miami area. Of the 60 people charged, 16 defendants were Colombian nationals who were pesos brokers or business owners, 9 defendants were Colombian couriers residing in the United States, and 35 defendants were employees of 16 businesses located in the South Florida area. Since the indictments, 50 individuals have pled guilty or were found guilty. In addition to the indictments, the United States is pursuing the forfeiture of over $3.6 million, which represented the monies associated with the laundering scheme.

The centerpiece of this investigation was an undercover storefront in operation for approximately 3 years. IRS undercover agents staffed the storefront and acted as an intermediary for Colombian money brokers to launder narcotics proceeds. The undercover agents arranged with the brokers to have couriers deliver the narcotics proceeds to the storefront. A significant portion of the money delivered was used to purchase merchandise from businesses in the Miami area. The merchandise was shipped to Colombia to complete the BMPE cycle.

Operations Powerplay & Pressure Point

In an effort to attack the illegal exportation of unreported currency derived from suspected illicit activities, Customs initiated two currency smuggling investigative efforts known as Operations Powerplay and Pressure Point. These two nationally coordinated operations focused on identifying, arresting, and prosecuting violators involved with transporting proceeds out of the United States. As a result of these two operations, Customs made 525 currency seizures totaling over $16.8 million, resulting in 224 arrests. Customs special agents and inspectors intensified their outbound enforcement operations by targeting air, sea, and land passengers, air cargo, sea cargo, courier hubs, courier bags, inbound mail facilities, and land borders in search of unreported currency in violation of federal law.

Customs officers identified and seized bulk cash shipments concealed in automobiles, trailers, bicycle tires, food products, stereo equipment, internal body carriers, clothing, shoes, luggage, and express courier parcels. To assist in their outbound enforcement efforts, Customs used canines specially trained to sniff out cash as well as x-ray technology to scan large pieces of cargo and containers.

Customs determined that 38 percent of the seizures occurred at airports, 27 percent at land borders, 21 percent from couriers, 13 percent as result of investigations, and 1 percent from seaports. More than half of all the seized cash was destined for Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Israel, Colombia, Guatemala, and Jamaica.

Operation Southwest Express

In August 1998, the FBI initiated a nationwide investigation code named ""Operation Southwest Express"" targeting the San Diego-based drug trafficking organization of Omar Rocha Soto (Rocha). This multi-jurisdictional/multi-divisional investigation was carried out in conjunction with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.

During the course of the operation, investigations were conducted in San Diego, California; El Paso, Texas; Houston, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; and New York City and Utica, New York.

The Rocha organization was believed to be associated with the smuggling of ton quantities of cocaine and marijuana through Mexico, with distribution networks throughout the United States. In particular, the Rocha organization was believed to have been one of the twenty largest drug distribution organizations in the United States. The Rocha organization also laundered large quantities of U.S. currency in an attempt to disguise the profits derived from their illegal activities. Furthermore, this group utilized automobiles, tractor-trailers, and railway systems to transport illegal drugs and money to and from major American cities such as Houston, Chicago, and New York.

When Operation Southwest Express was concluded in August 1999, more than 100 subjects were indicted throughout the United States. The arrested individuals faced charges including money laundering, drug distribution, and conspiracy. During this investigation, more than 4,100 pounds of marijuana, 2,700 kilograms of cocaine, and $1 million were seized. Additionally, the majority of the indicted subjects have either pled guilty or been convicted by federal juries.

Russian Money Laundering Operation

In February 2000, a couple pled guilty in a Manhattan federal court to a variety of charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, operating an unlawful banking and money transmitting business and aiding and abetting Russian banks in conducting unlawful and unlicensed banking activities in the United States. A large number of Russian individuals and businesses used this illegal banking operation to transfer and receive money in violation of Russian currency control limitations and to promote a variety of schemes to defraud the Russian government of customs duties and taxes.

This particular operation was originally centered upon a company called Benex International, Inc., in Forest Hills, Queens. Benex was small, but despite its size, it intersected in a number of ways with a world wide money laundering infrastructure. Benex had an account at the Bank of New York and during one eighteen month period, it moved more than $4.2 billion through the account, utilizing over 8,000 monthly transactions. The head of this operation was Peter Berlin, a Russian who married a United States citizen named Lucy Edwards.

Their scheme began in late 1995, when Berlin and his wife, who then worked for the Bank of New York in Manhattan, entered into a pact with certain individuals who controlled the Russian bank DKB (Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank). Berlin opened an account at the Bank of New York, and, with his wife's help, gained access to electronic banking software available to certain select customers. With this software Berlin and his associates were able to direct wire transfers in their account at the Bank of New York.

By early 1996, Berlin had access to the software and his wife installed it in the Forest Hills offices. Those offices served DKB. Using several Russian correspondent bank accounts opened at the Bank of New York, DKB transferred funds into the Benex account in bulk amounts on a continuous basis. DKB then issued daily instructions from its offices in Moscow to the employees in the Benex offices to transfer funds out of the Benex account, using the software, to a large number of third parties around the world.

By the fall of 1998, Berlin and Edwards had established two additional corporations (BECS International L.L.C. and Lowland Inc.) to move money. Benex, BECS and Lowland were not licensed to act as money-transmitting businesses nor were they authorized to conduct banking operations in the United States on behalf of foreign banks, but offered a back-channel method of secretly and illegally transferring funds in and out of Russia.

Ultimately, more than $7 billion moved through the Bank of New York accounts of Benex, BECS and Lowland from February 1996 to August 1999. During this time, Berlin and Edwards received a total of approximately $1.8 million in commissions, much of which they laundered and funneled into foreign bank accounts. In excess of $15 million has been seized by authorities and litigation continues. The case is ongoing and many matters remain to be adjudicated.

Sergio Rubalcava Sandoval Drug Trafficking Organization

This investigation originated in August 1997 as part of the FBI undercover operation entitled ""Crosswire."" Sergio Rubalcava Sandoval was identified as a large-scale drug trafficker and former Baja California State Judicial Police officer with close ties to Ismael Higuera-Guerrero, a command and control figure of the Arellano-Felix Drug Cartel.

Through various investigative methods, agents determined that Sandoval, his wife, and several of his associates in the United States purchased land, houses, boats and helicopters as a means to launder drug proceeds generated by the organization. The FBI obtained a federal indictment for Sandoval and fifteen of his associates, charging each with several counts including drug trafficking and money laundering.

On March 21, 2000, Sandoval and his wife pled guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering charges bringing the total of subjects convicted in the case to thirteen. The FBI documented over $10 million in laundered proceeds and seized over $1 million in assets.

Terrorist Financing Operation

In 1999, terrorists launched 392 attacks, killing 233 people and wounding 706 others worldwide.(1) Many of the terrorist organizations responsible for these acts are believed to have financial support infrastructures in the United States and in many other developed countries. Legislation enacted in 1996 enables us to better detect, deter and punish those who finance terrorism. United States law enforcement authorities are now aggressively using the newest tools available in the fight against terrorist financing, including laws that make it a crime to knowingly provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization.

(1) Patterns of Global Terrorism—1999, United States Department of State Publication 10687, April 2000.

A wide-ranging joint FBI and Department of Treasury investigation into interstate cigarette smuggling, involving a suspected Hizballah terrorist cell operating in Charlotte, North Carolina, led to the July 21, 2000 arrest by U.S. authorities of 18 individuals. Ten days later a federal grand jury in North Carolina indicted these individuals, including seven suspected Hizballah supporters, for immigration fraud and related bribery and conspiracies; conspiring to smuggle contraband cigarettes; and conspiring to launder money. Many of the defendants continue to be detained prior to trial, while the investigation continues.

At least seven of the defendants are suspected members of, or sympathetic to Hizballah, a foreign terrorist organization designated as such under U.S. law in 1997 and again in 1999. These seven defendants appear to be providing material support or resources to Hizballah in violation of U.S. law.

The indictment alleges that seven of the indicted defendants entered into fraudulent marriages with United States citizens in order to obtain permanent resident status, which would permit them to remain indefinitely in the United States. Having arranged for presence in the United States between March 1996 and July 2000, several of the defendants smuggled large quantities of contraband cigarettes, purchasing them in North Carolina, where the state cigarette tax is $0.50 per carton, and illicitly transporting them to Michigan for resale, where the state cigarette tax is $7.50 per carton. During the same period, these defendants laundered the funds involved in and derived from the conspiracy through various bank and credit card accounts.

The defendants are each facing substantial periods of incarceration, criminal fines and asset forfeiture. Among the assets that may be subject to forfeiture are two residences, a BP service station, an undetermined amount of U.S. currency, five late model vehicles and 30 bank accounts. At the request of the defense, the trial will likely be continued to April 2001.

Bilateral Activities

Training and Technical Assistance

During 2000, a number of U.S. law enforcement and regulatory agencies provided training and technical assistance on money laundering countermeasures and financial investigations to their law enforcement, financial regulatory, and prosecutorial counterparts around the globe. These courses have been designed to give financial investigators, bank regulators, and prosecutors the necessary tools to recognize, investigate, and prosecute money laundering, financial crimes, and related criminal activity. Courses have been provided in the U.S. as well as in the jurisdictions where the programs are targeted.

Department of State

The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) developed a fiscal year 2000 $4.0 million program for providing law enforcement, prosecutorial and central bank training to countries around the globe. A prime focus of the training program was a multi-agency approach to develop or enhance financial crime and anti-money laundering regimes in selected jurisdictions. Supported by and in coordination with INL, the Department of Justice, Treasury Department component agencies, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and non-government organizations offered law enforcement, regulatory and criminal justice programs worldwide.

During 2000, INL funded over 60 programs to combat international financial crimes and money laundering in 35 countries. Nearly every federal law enforcement agency assisted in this effort by providing basic and advanced training courses in all aspects of financial criminal activity. In addition, funds were made available for intermittent posting of financial advisors at selected overseas locations. The advisors work directly with the host government to assist in the creation, implementation, and enforcement of anti-money laundering and financial crime legislation. Further, several federal agencies were provided funding to conduct multiagency financial crime training assessments and develop specialized training in specific jurisdictions worldwide to combat money laundering.

In addition to funding specific training and technical assistance anti-money laundering courses around the globe, INL provided funding for other important anti-money laundering projects in 2000. For example, funding assistance was provided for the October Pacific Rim Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Conference held in Vancouver, Canada.

Also, INL continues to fund the Caribbean Anti-Money Laundering Programme (CALP) along with funding from the European Union and the Government of the United Kingdom. The objectives of CALP are to reduce the incidence of the laundering of the proceeds of all serious crime by facilitating the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of money laundering. CALP also seeks to develop a sustainable institutional capacity in the Caribbean region to address the issues related to anti-money laundering efforts at a local, regional and international level.

INL continues to provide significant financial support for many of the anti-money laundering bodies around the globe. During 2000, support was furnished to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, CFATF, COE, and the FATF. In 2000, additional support was provided to the APG and COE to conduct mutual evaluation training programs for their members.

As in previous years, INL training programs continue to focus on the interagency approach and bringing together, where possible, foreign law enforcement, judicial and central bank authorities in assessments and training programs. This allows for an extensive dialogue and exchange of information. This approach has been used successfully in Asia, Central and South America, Russia, the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, and Central Europe. INL also provides funding for many of the regional training and technical assistance programs offered by the various law enforcement agencies, including those at the International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs).

The following summary provides a glimpse of training activities undertaken in 2000 by U.S. law enforcement agencies.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve has a long-standing commitment to combating money laundering and ensuring compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and related suspicious activity reporting requirements by the domestic and foreign banking organizations that it supervises. Federal Reserve staff has provided training in anti-money laundering procedures to foreign law enforcement officials and central bank supervisory personnel in dozens of jurisdictions each year. Some examples include: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Poland, Russia, South Pacific jurisdictions, United Arab Emirates and Uruguay. In addition, training has been provided by Federal Reserve staff to U.S. law enforcement agencies including programs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and at the FBI Academy, as well as regular and frequent training for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Customs Service.

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

International Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Seminars are a part of the U.S. Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Program conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of Training, International Training Section. The intent of these seminars is to share, compare, and contrast U.S. legislation with that of other countries, building relationships and fostering communications with foreign narcotics enforcement and prosecutorial personnel. On average, the yearly budget allotted is $420,000 to complete five seminars. Each seminar provides instruction to 35 to 50 high-level foreign drug law enforcement and money-laundering specialists.

DEA's primary focus for its training courses includes specialized training for foreign central bank regulators, police and customs officials, and prosecutors. Course materials include training in U.S. asset forfeiture laws, asset and financial gathering techniques, financial investigation techniques, case studies, document exploitation, and international banking.

Training is designed for one-week seminars involving lectures, presentations, case studies, and practical application exercises. Guest lecturers from various areas of the U.S. Government participate, including from the Department of Justice, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Marshal Service, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve as well as from various divisional offices of DEA.

This training is focused on cultures with economic systems developed enough to accommodate money laundering activities. All seminars are conducted in the host country. During 2000, seminars were conducted in the following locations: Hungary, Panama, Peru, Singapore, South Africa and Spain. In addition, DEA conducted a money laundering training session in Brasilia, Brazil, which was funded by the Department of State.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

The FBI Money Laundering Unit conducts training with the goal of providing international law enforcement with the ability to adequately investigate various methods of money laundering. The training emphasizes the techniques that money launderers use to conceal or disguise the true nature of illicit cash proceeds and provides law enforcement with the ability to trace the location, source, or ownership of these proceeds.

The FBI has either exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over 150 of the 176 ""Specified Unlawful Activities"" (SUAs) under the United States money laundering statutes. This expansive jurisdiction has allowed the FBI to gain extensive experience in unconventional money laundering methodologies associated with various SUAs in areas such as organized crime, drugs, violent crime, and white collar crime. This experience places the FBI in a unique position to provide expert training in traditional and non-traditional money laundering investigations across a broad spectrum of SUAs.

The FBI has also provided experts for advanced training in areas of traditional and emerging technologies such as digital cash, smart cards, Internet banking, the Black Market Peso Exchange, and bulk cash shipments. Further, the FBI provides technical assistance for the new tools that law enforcement are using to investigate money laundering activities such as geographic targeting orders, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and Suspicious Activity Report Task Forces.

The FBI provides training independently and in conjunction with other federal, state, and local agencies within the United States and internationally. The FBI's money laundering unit has worked with the United Nations in conferences to provide a United States perspective on successful tactics used to disrupt and dismantle money laundering industries and facilities. On other occasions, the FBI has provided independent money laundering training and briefings at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia and at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.

During 2000, the FBI participated in money laundering and financial crimes training courses in: Chisinau, Moldova; Islamabad, Pakistan; Panama City, Panama; Warsaw, Poland; Volgograd, Russia; Irkutsk, Russia; Bratislava, Slovakia; Kiev, Ukraine; and Hanoi, Vietnam.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

FinCEN, the U.S. financial intelligence unit (FIU), has an international training program that focuses on providing training and technical assistance to a broad spectrum of foreign government officials, financial regulators, law enforcement personnel, and bankers. This training covers a wide variety of topics, including money laundering typologies, the creation and operation of FIUs, assistance in the establishment of comprehensive anti-money laundering regimes, computer systems architecture and operations, and assessments of country-specific money laundering regimes and regulations. FinCEN also works closely with the Egmont Group of FIUs to provide training and technical assistance to various jurisdictions for establishing and operating their own FIUs.

FinCEN participated in four seminars in El Salvador in 2000 to train Salvadoran officials on anti-money laundering techniques. Seminars in March and May focused on training personnel of the newly formed financial intelligence unit. A July seminar trained members of the banking Superintendency, as well as compliance officers from various private banks, on money laundering and compliance issues and in September a seminar focused on training tax auditors and investigators.

FinCEN conducted two personnel exchanges with the Korean and Belgian FIUs. Additionally, FinCEN provided financial intelligence unit and money laundering briefings to visitors from a number of jurisdictions including Argentina, Armenia, Australia, the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Isle of Man, Jamaica, Jersey, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Italy, Liechtenstein, Nauru, Netherlands, Palau, Russia, Seychelles, Switzerland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Taiwan, Thailand, Tonga, and the United Kingdom.

In May 2000, FinCEN was invited by the UN Global Programme against Money Laundering to give several presentations at a weeklong joint UN/GCC seminar on money laundering that was held in Abu Dhabi. In August 2000, FinCEN organized and took part in a three-day seminar in Montevideo for 60 Uruguayan bankers, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials. FinCEN also participated in several U.S. Secret Service organized financial crimes training seminars in Russia and China during the year.

FinCEN participated in an interagency team visit to the South Pacific to assess the feasibility of creating a regional Financial Intelligence Unit there. The assessment team also included representatives from the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering, South Pacific Forum Secretariat, Australia and New Zealand. The team visited Fiji, the Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Samoa.

FinCEN hosted three visits in 2000 by members of the task force setting up Korea's FIU. The first visit in May focused on orientation; the second visit in July covered information technology experts who will develop systems to store and exploit SAR and CTR data envisioned in Korea's anti-money laundering legislation. The third visit, which occurred in October 2000, was a financial analysis course for Korean FIU analysts and investigators.

During the week of October 30, a FinCEN analyst traveled with a State Department INL representative to Paraguay to assess the status of the country's anti-money laundering program. The team conducted meetings with Paraguay's FIU, the antidrug secretariat, the Attorney General, the central bank President, and the Superintendent of Banks. FinCEN also conducted two briefings for private banking officials.

In October, FinCEN participated in an interagency money laundering training assessment trip to China. The delegation met with senior officials of the Ministry of Public Security, People's Bank of China, Supreme People's Procuraturate, National Audit Office, Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, along with Beijing-based executives of some U.S. banks.

As follow-on to the China visit, the U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong requested that the China assessment delegation visit Macau to discuss the jurisdiction's anti-money laundering regime. Macau agencies visited included the Macau Association of Banks, Judiciary Police, Monetary Authority of Macau, Macau Special Administrative Region's Legislative Affairs Office, and unofficial meetings with a casino representative and a Macanese police officer.

In December, FinCEN hosted delegations from Nigeria, Tanzania, and South Africa for discussions on anti-money laundering legislation. The participants were briefed on U.S. laws, regulations and programs of implementation. Individual meetings were held with each delegation to consult on its country's efforts in this area. The intent of the program was to provide each country with a clearer understanding of the requirements of current anti-money laundering recommendations and to develop an understanding of the political climate and legislative processes in each country.

Internal Revenue Service

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Criminal Investigations Division, International Training Program is one segment of the IRS international strategy. IRS focuses its training on investigative techniques courses involving financial crime and money laundering. The goal of this training is to provide assistance to foreign governments in establishing or enhancing money laundering, criminal, tax and asset forfeiture laws. In addition, the training program provides assistance in the investigation of violations of these laws and promotes enhanced anti-money laundering regimes that conform to international standards.

IRS develops and conducts training courses independently, as well as with other agencies. In some instances these courses are developed jointly with other law enforcement agencies to address a specific need. IRS participates on an ad hoc basis with other agencies as part of their curricula and invites other agencies to participate in IRS training.

Training led by IRS during 2000 included:

Financial Investigative Techniques training in Lagos, Nigeria, Ufa, Russia and Budapest, Hungary.
Money laundering training in Kazan, Russia, Beijing, China and Mexico City, Mexico.
Advanced money laundering training in Mexico City, Mexico.
Complex Financial Investigations training in Bangkok, Thailand (taught jointly with the U.S. Customs Service).

IRS participates in the core course program at ILEA Budapest and ILEA Bangkok. IRS also participated in training sponsored by other USG agencies in Romania, Costa Rica, and Russia. In addition, the IRS took part in a training needs assessment in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Department of Justice

The Overseas Prosecutor Development and Training Section (OPDAT) of the Criminal Division is the primary source for the training of foreign prosecutors, judges and law enforcement for the Department of Justice. During 2000, OPDAT sponsored 13 seminars throughout the world that dealt in whole or in part with money laundering and asset forfeiture issues. Approximately 800 students received training in transnational money laundering, international asset forfeiture and asset sharing. Additionally, the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section conducted an Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina which included approximately 200 prosecutors and law enforcement officials from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia.

Secret Service

The Secret Service continues to be extensively involved in training foreign government officials and law enforcement in the areas of financial fraud schemes and counterfeit U.S. currency investigations. In 2000, the Secret Service taught foreign officials to identify and investigate violations that impact on their jurisdictions as well as those of the Secret Service. Specific financial fraud schemes involving credit cards, smart cards, electronic fund transfers, fictitious financial instruments, ""4-1-9"" advance fee fraud, cellular telephone fraud, skimming, telemarketing fraud, identity theft and other types of schemes were highlighted. These crimes represent the underlying Specific Unlawful Activities (SUA's) that provide the nexus for the Secret Service to conduct money laundering investigations.

The goal of the Secret Service foreign training program is to train and assist the foreign participants with their financial systems, and to establish a permanent conduit for information exchange and liaison. The previously mentioned SUA's were highlighted in an effort to concentrate all available resources on the root of the criminal activity.

Training programs have varied depending on the foreign participants. The training initiative throughout 2000 proved invaluable in fostering a heightened awareness for foreign government officials and law enforcement in the identification of systemic weaknesses within financial systems. In training foreign law enforcement officials, the Secret Service conducted comprehensive programs that included an emphasis on crimes involving electronic commerce.

Smart cards, generally issued by non-banking financial service providers such as large brokerage houses, operate completely outside of any U.S. government regulations. This lack of regulatory oversight creates vulnerability as no record is created or maintained on the transfer of data. In theory, financial information and monetary funds can be accessed, manipulated, and transferred to or from an account, or from card to card, with no ""footprint"" being made. Systems that support this industry can move billions of dollars a day through computer networks that often are not regulated or controlled by any government entity.

Skimming is the unauthorized capture and replication of data from a person's credit card through the use of a small, hand-held device, which can later be used to download the information for illicit purposes. The ease and speed with which information can be gathered and used for illegal purposes in a skimming operation represents a threat to financial institutions around the world. The Secret Service has trained foreign law enforcement officials about the type of equipment, manner of operation, and distribution methods for the information taken from unsuspecting credit card holders. Industry sources have estimated that skimming outside of the United States alone affects approximately one hundred seventy five different businesses per week. This large number of compromised points of sale has the potential to cause many millions of dollars in fraud losses.

During 2000, the Secret Service, using INL-provided funds, conducted training for foreign law enforcement and financial institutions in China, Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Lithuania. Additional presentations were made at the ILEAs in Budapest, Hungary and Bangkok, Thailand. The Secret Service provided independent classes in Greece, Romania, Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria, Columbia, and at the Interpol conference in Lyon, France.

One of the more notable examples of interagency cooperation occurred when the Senior Special Agent assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, working with the embassy's country team, collaborated on an investigation into a ""4-1-9"" type financial crime. A bank in North Carolina had been victimized when approximately $425,000 was wired to Lagos. Thanks to the swift and aggressive action by the Secret Service and Department of State, the entire amount of the fraud scheme was recovered and returned to North Carolina.

United States Customs Service

The U.S. Customs Service (USCS), Office of Investigations, Financial Investigations Division continues to be extensively involved in the INL-sponsored multi-agency international money laundering training programs. Drawing on its expertise in undercover drug money laundering as well as traditional money laundering investigations, the USCS strives to impart its considerable experience to law enforcement, regulatory, and banking officials identified by INL.

As host or co-host with numerous other federal agencies, the USCS conducted anti-money laundering and financial crime seminars domestically and abroad for officials from sixteen nations. Approximately 725 representatives from foreign nations received USCS anti-money laundering training in FY2000.

United States Department of Treasury Office of Technical Assistance (IET)

Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance is located within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs. The office delivers interactive, advisor-based assistance to senior level representatives in various ministries and central banks in the areas of tax reform, government debt issuance and management, budget policy and management, financial institution reform, and more recently, law enforcement reforms related to money laundering and other financial crimes.

In 1997, the Enforcement Program was added to Treasury's advisory office. It is a long-term, advisor-based program developed out of concern that financial crime, corruption, organized criminal enterprises, and other criminal activities were undermining economic reforms promoted by the Department of the Treasury. The Enforcement Program essentially focuses on the development of legal foundations, policies, and organizations in three areas: (1) money laundering and other financial crimes, (2) organized crime and corruption, and (3) the reorganization of law enforcement and financial entities in developing economies to help them prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute sophisticated international financial crime. The Enforcement Program relies on intermittent advisory trips to deliver its technical assistance. It works with embassy staff and host country clients on long-term projects designed to promote systemic changes and new organizational structures. The program receives most of its funding and outside guidance from the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). Originally operating in only two countries using Treasury funds, the last two years have seen a rapid expansion of the program with the support of INL funding. The program has now given technical assistance to over a dozen countries throughout the world. The demands on the program are likely to increase even further as international anti-money laundering efforts increase.

The Enforcement Program is comprised of a group of approximately 30 highly experienced advisors with backgrounds in various areas of financial and economic crimes such as money laundering, white collar crime, organized crime, securities fraud, internal affairs and corruption, criminal law, and organization administration. Most advisors have previously held responsible positions with U.S. law enforcement and regulatory organizations or prosecutors with the Department of Justice. In addition, the office cooperates closely in its programs with all components of Treasury and Justice law enforcement, especially FinCEN, IRS, USSS and USCS.

During 2000 extensive projects were conducted in a number of countries. For example in Armenia the ""Armenia"" Enforcement Team provided technical assistance in the areas of financial crimes, organized crime, gaming crimes, and insurance fraud. To assist in establishing an effective liaison with U.S. law enforcement, the Enforcement Team arranged for the Armenian Prosecutor General and other assistants to meet with appropriate U.S. officials in Washington, DC and in Los Angeles. Finally, the team facilitated the assessment of a program to develop a centralized computer system for the Office of the Prosecutor General and Directorate Six.

The Enforcement Team also played a significant part in drafting and implementing the anti-money laundering law in El Salvador. It has helped to design, staff and build the El Salvador Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), under the direction of the Attorney General. The team sponsored a visit by members of the FIU and the Attorney General to the FIUs in Mexico and Costa Rica so they could learn from their regional counterparts. The team then helped train the members of the FIU, along with some judges and prosecutors, in aspects of money laundering and financial crimes investigation. Additionally, training courses on Financial Crimes were provided to the Superintendent of Banking and the Finance Ministry.

In Georgia, the ""Georgia"" Enforcement Team in cooperation with USAID, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, completed a report on the enforcement authorities of the National Securities Exchange. Working cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Justice, it has assessed the adequacy of Georgia's Law on Conflict of Interest and Corruption, and the practical application of its reporting regime.

The Enforcement Team developed and delivered two separate training programs designed to enhance the forensic accounting abilities of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) personnel and to provide knowledge and abilities relating to financial investigations and asset recovery. The first program addressed the needs of attendees as they related to anti-corruption and general forensic accounting and financial crime investigative principles and techniques. The second addressed these principles and techniques along with asset recovery techniques as they related to specific cases being investigated by IBRA, as well as providing specific case direction and investigative and prosecutorial strategies. Assistance was centered on methods of identifying assets constituting bank fraud proceeds, tracing such proceeds to the U.S., and repatriating those assets once identifications were complete. The Indonesians also met with the FBI, DOJ prosecutors, Customs, Interpol and other U.S. government representatives regarding cooperation and coordination of future assistance that may be useful in detecting, investigating and prosecuting violations of U.S. law as well as repatriating the proceeds from Indonesian bank fraud.

In Moldova, the Enforcement Team provided technical assistance to the drafters of the economic and financial crime section of the criminal procedure code currently under consideration in Parliament. The team also provided technical assistance to the drafters of the proposed anti-money laundering law. The team assisted the Finance Ministry in organizing a tax evasion enforcement unit and a bank fraud working group. The team also provided specialized forensic training and assistance in combating credit card fraud, document fraud, and developing the capabilities of the government's forensic laboratories.

Advisors from the Enforcement Team also made visits to Peru and Malaysia to assist in drafting and discussing proposed anti-money laundering legislation.

International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs)

The ILEA training academies around the globe conduct a variety of law enforcement courses to mid-level managers. Core law enforcement training courses include modules on financial crime and money laundering. In addition, financial crime and money laundering seminars for senior law enforcement officials have been conducted in 2000.

Europe

The ILEA in Budapest, Hungary offers a core law enforcement training course targeted at mid-level managers in the police and criminal justice services of Central Europe and the New Independent States. Over 1,300 officials from 25 countries have successfully completed this course. In addition to this program, ILEA Budapest also offers regional seminars and specialized training courses. More than 3,500 criminal justice officials have participated in such courses.

Asia

The ILEA for Southeast Asia opened in March 1999, in Bangkok, Thailand. The curriculum and structure of this Academy is similar to that in Budapest, except for the duration of the core course and an added emphasis in narcotics matters. ILEA Bangkok also offers specialized courses in a wide range of topics. Over 1,000 officials from 10 Southeast Asian nations have attended these courses.

The Americas

For the Western Hemisphere, we offered a core course similar to Bangkok's—tailored to regional needs—for officials from Central America and the Dominican Republic. Two pilot courses were conducted in Panama in 1997 at a temporary site. Sixty-four participants attended these courses. All activities of this Academy have been temporarily suspended, pending a review to determine its permanent location.

Africa

The interagency group responsible for the ILEAs is taking steps aimed at the establishment and operation of an ILEA for Southern Africa, to be located in Gaborone, Botswana. The overall format for this new Academy will be similar to the other three, adjusted to suit the needs of the region.

Treaties, Agreements, and Other Mechanisms for Information Exchange

Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) allow generally for the exchange of evidence and information in criminal and ancillary matters. In money laundering cases, they can be extremely useful as a means of obtaining banking and other financial records from our treaty partners. MLATs, which are negotiated by the Department of State in cooperation with the Department of Justice to facilitate cooperation in criminal matters, including money laundering and asset forfeiture, are in force with the following countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominica, Estonia, Grenada, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Spain, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom with respect to its Caribbean overseas territories (Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands), and Uruguay. MLATs have been signed by the United States but not yet brought into force with the following countries: Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and Venezuela. The United States has also signed the Organization of American States MLAT and the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The United States is actively engaged in negotiating additional MLATs with countries around the world. The United States has also concluded executive agreements for cooperation in various criminal matters with Russia, Haiti, the Philippines, and Venezuela. Comparable executive agreements with Nigeria, Singapore and China are signed but were not yet in force as of the end of 2000.

In addition, the United States has entered into executive agreements on forfeiture cooperation, including: (1) an agreement with the United Kingdom providing for forfeiture assistance and asset sharing in narcotics cases; and (2) a forfeiture cooperation and asset sharing agreement with the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The United States has asset sharing agreements with Canada, the Cayman Islands (which was extended to Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands), Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico.

To facilitate the ongoing exchange of information to combat money laundering, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has fostered information exchange with other financial intelligence units (FIUs) around the globe, as well as, on a case by case basis, law enforcement and regulatory agencies of foreign governments. In a few cases (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, France, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom), information exchange arrangements involving FinCEN and other FIUs have been reduced to writing in the form of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) or an exchange of letters. Prior to the establishment of these types of information exchange arrangements, the United States in limited circumstances entered into cooperation agreements referred to as Financial Information Exchange Agreements (FIEAs) for the exchange of ""currency transaction information"" with the governments of certain Latin American countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela). FinCEN's methods of exchanging information with other FIUs as described above are intended to supplant the old FIEA model.

The United States has Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements (CMAAs) with the European Community and with the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Mexico, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Yugoslavia. (The U.S. view is that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved and that the CMAA continues to apply to the successors that formerly made up the SFRY—Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). The United States has CMAAs, negotiated but not yet in force, with the following countries: PRC, Lithuania, Panama, the Philippines, South Africa, Turkey, and Venezuela. All of the agreements are patterned after a Customs Organization Model CMAA. Since assistance can be provided in the enforcement of any laws related to customs, the U.S. Customs Service uses these agreements to assist in the gathering of information and evidence for criminal and civil cases involving trade fraud, smuggling, violations of export control laws, and most recently, in the growing effort to combat narcotics trafficking and money laundering.

Asset Sharing

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. � 981(i), 21 U.S.C. � 881(e)(1)(E), and 31 U.S.C. � 9703(h)(2), the United States is authorized to share assets with countries that facilitate the forfeiture of criminal proceeds. Under this authority, the Departments of Justice, State and Treasury have aggressively sought to encourage foreign governments to cooperate in joint investigations of drug trafficking and money laundering, offering the possibility of sharing in forfeited assets. A parallel goal has been to encourage spending of these assets to improve narcotics law enforcement. The long-term goal has been to encourage governments to improve asset forfeiture laws and procedures, so that they will be able to conduct investigations and prosecutions of drug trafficking and money laundering which includes asset forfeiture. The United States and its partners in the G-8 are currently pursuing a program to strengthen asset forfeiture and sharing regimes. To date, Canada, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Jersey, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have shared forfeited assets with the United States.

From its inception in 1989 through December 2000, the international asset-sharing program administered by the Department of Justice has resulted in the forfeiture in the United States $389,229,322.96 of which $169,397,852.33 was shared with foreign governments that cooperated and assisted in the investigations. In 2000, the Department of Justice transferred forfeited proceeds to Barbados ($100,000.00); Canada ($37,809.97); Ecuador ($14,850.00); Hong Kong ($907,403.00); Switzerland ($226,447.88); Thailand ($19,144.00) and United Kingdom ($612,500.00). Prior recipients of shared assets (1989-1999) include: Argentina, the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Guernsey, Hungary, Isle of Man, Israel, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands Antilles, Paraguay, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.

From its inception in 1995 through December 2000, the international asset sharing program administered by the Department of Treasury has resulted in the forfeiture in the United States of approximately $13,404,441.00 of which $6,412,864.00 was shared with foreign governments which cooperated and assisted in the investigations. In 2000, the Department of Treasury transferred forfeited proceeds to Cayman Islands ($2,680,803.00); Canada ($241,446.00); Dominican Republic ($63,885.00); Netherlands ($1,717,213.00); Portugal ($85,840.00); Switzerland ($903,934.00) and United Kingdom ($719,743.00). Prior recipients of shared assets (1995-1999) include Aruba, the Bahamas, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Egypt, Guernsey, Jersey, Mexico, Qatar, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Multilateral Activities

Financial Action Task Force

The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which was established at the G-7 Economic Summit in Paris in 1989, is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of policies to combat money laundering. In 1990, the FATF issued Forty Recommendations to fight this phenomenon. The Recommendations were revised in 1996 to reflect changes in money laundering trends. These recommendations are designed to prevent proceeds of crime from being utilized in future criminal activities and from affecting legitimate economic activities.

In June 2000, membership of the FATF expanded from 26 to 29 governments(1) and two regional organizations(2), representing the major financial centers of North America, Europe and Asia. Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, who had participated in the work of the FATF as observers since September 1999, were accepted as full members. The delegations of the Task Force's members are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, including experts from the Ministries of Finance, Justice, Interior and External Affairs, financial regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.

(1) Argentina; Australia; Austria; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hong Kong, China; Iceland; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Luxembourg; Mexico; the Kingdom of the Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Portugal; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey; the United Kingdom and the United States.

(2) European Commission and Gulf Co-operation Council.

FATF focused on several major initiatives during 2000. As mentioned, FATF took concrete steps to enlarge its membership with the completions of the mutual evaluations of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. The principal objective of these evaluations was to determine whether these countries complied with certain fundamental anti-money laundering requirements, the implementation of which is a pre-condition to becoming a full member of the FATF.

Throughout 2000, the FATF continued its efforts to persuade Austria to eliminate its system of anonymous savings passbooks. On February 3, 2000, the FATF decided to suspend Austria as one of its members in June 2000 unless action was taken to eliminate anonymous passbooks. Following this unprecedented move, the Government of Austria took the appropriate steps to meet the conditions required by the FATF and thus avert suspension of its membership, through new legislation and issuance of a banking circular.

The year 2000 also marked the completion of FATF's first phase of the important work on Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs). This work resulted in the June publication of a report entitled Review to Identify Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories: Increasing the Worldwide Effectiveness of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (1). This report describes the process and provides summaries of jurisdictions considered to be of concern. The aim of the work is to enhance the level of protection for the world's financial system and to prevent the circumvention of the anti-laundering measures introduced over the last ten years. To ensure transparency and sound operation in the international financial system, it is desirable that all financial centers across the world have comprehensive controls, regulations and supervisory arrangements in place and that all financial agents assume anti-money laundering obligations.

(1)This report can be found on the FATF home page at http://www.oecd.org/fatf.

To tackle this question, fatf established an Ad Hoc Group on NCCTs to discuss in more depth the action to be taken with regard to these countries and territories. Throughout 2000, the Ad Hoc Group on NCCTs met in the margins of all FATF Plenary meetings, and autonomously on May 24-25, 2000 in Paris. After the FATF adopted criteria for defining non-cooperative countries and territories, 29 jurisdictions were selected for review in February 2000. The assessments took place between February and June. Fifteen of those counties (Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Dominica, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Panama, Philippines, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) were identified in the report as having serious deficiencies in their anti-money laundering systems and thus named ""non-cooperative."" Immediately following the issuance of the June NCCT report, the G-7 members issued advisories to their financial institutions recommending increased scrutiny of transactions involving these jurisdictions. A number of other FATF members followed with similar advisories.

The FATF then determined that additional jurisdictions should be examined in the second round of NCCT reviews and took stock of the progress made by the 15 jurisdictions identified in June. On October 5, 2000, the FATF issued a press release that welcomed the significant, rapid progress made by many of the jurisdictions that it had identified in June as ""non-cooperative"" in the fight against money laundering. As of October, seven of the NCCTs (Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Israel, Liechtenstein, Panama and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) had enacted legislation to address deficiencies identified by the FATF and several others had taken steps or made political commitments to do the same. The FATF decided to monitor progress towards meeting international standards and addressing the deficiencies previously identified. For example, in the context of the dialogue initiated by the FATF's NCCT exercise, the Governor of the Central Bank of Seychelles informed the FATF President that the Economic Development Act 1995 has been repealed on July 25, 2000. The FATF therefore lifted Recommendation 21 against the Seychelles.

In February 2001, FATF issued a press release acknowledging that seven jurisdictions—the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Israel, Liechtenstein, the Marshall Islands and Panama—have enacted most, if not all, legislation needed to remedy the deficiencies identified in June 2000. On the basis of that progress, those seven jurisdictions have been invited to submit to FATF implementation plans to enable FATF to evaluate the actual implementation of the legislative changes. The FATF will be assessing the progress made by these jurisdictions during 2001 to determine whether any jurisdictions should be removed from the list of NCCTs. These assessments will be done initially by the FATF review groups, including through face-to-face meetings, and will be discussed as a priority item at each Plenary of FATF. In making these assessments, the FATF will look for the existence of comprehensive and effective anti-money laundering systems. Decisions to add or delete countries from the list published in June 2000 will be taken in the FATF Plenary in June 2001.

In deciding whether a jurisdiction should be removed from the list, the FATF Plenary must be satisfied that the jurisdiction has addressed the deficiencies previously identified. The FATF will rely on its collective judgment, and will attach particular importance to reforms in the area of criminal law, financial supervision, customer identification, suspicious activity reporting, and international co-operation. As necessary, legislation and regulations will need to be enacted and have come into effect before removal from the list can be considered. In addition, the FATF will seek to ensure that the jurisdiction is implementing the necessary reforms. Thus, information related to institutional arrangements, as well as the filing and utilization of suspicious activity reports, examinations of financial institutions, and the conduct of money laundering investigations, will be considered.

In 2000, the FATF agreed to initiate a review of the Forty Recommendations, including the issues of particular concern for anti-money laundering purposes identified in the June 2000 Report on NCCTs. The FATF discussed how best to approach this exercise and agreed that work should begin to conduct an initial examination on the specific issues of concern with the goal of establishing one or more working groups in 2001. The three major issues of concern are the identification of clients (e.g. through eligible introducers or through electronic banking transactions); non-financial professions (e.g. lawyers, accountants: a.k.a.: gatekeepers), and non-corporate entities (e.g. international business companies and trusts). This work will involve the participation of all FATF member countries as well as FATF-style regional bodies. It is also envisaged that FATF will involve the private sector at some stage of this review.

Under the chairmanship of the United States, the annual study of money laundering typologies was published in February 2000(1). The report was based on a meeting of experts, which was conducted in Washington, DC on November 18-19, 1999. This report covered the vulnerabilities of Internet banking; the increasing reach of alternative remittance systems; the role of company formation agents and their services; international trade-related activities as a cover for money laundering; and specific money laundering trends in various regions of the world. The 1999-2000 report represented the first time countries outside of the FATF participated in the typologies exercise making it an unprecedented and truly global review of anti-money laundering activity. On December 6-7, 2000 FATF conducted its subsequent experts meeting in Oslo, Norway. The specialized topics included on-line banking, trusts and other non-corporate entities, non-financial professionals, and the role of cash and alternate payment systems. The results of this meeting were published in February 2001.

The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) is in the unique position of being a member of FATF, but with non-FATF member countries as its constituents(2). During 2000, noticeable progress was made to improve the implementation of effective anti-money laundering systems within the GCC States. On January 17-18 2000, in Riyadh, the GCC held a technical seminar for its member States with the participation of the FATF Secretariat on the subject of self-assessment and mutual evaluation procedures. In addition, five members of the GCC (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) have agreed to undergo a mutual evaluation. The first on-site visit of these evaluations took place in Bahrain on June 5-7, 2000, and will be followed by other examinations.

The current mandate of the FATF, as agreed at a meeting of FATF's Ministers on April 28, 1998, calls for close co-operation with the relevant international organizations and in particular the international financial institutions (IFIs). Throughout 2000, the FATF discussed how to better incorporate measures against financial abuse into the IFIs activities. Mainly, the issues focused on information sharing between the FATF and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the availability of FATF experts to participate in IMF reviews and assessments, and the extent to which the FATF 40 Recommendations might appropriately be included in structural assessments performed by the IMF

The FATF continued to analyze the question of co-operation between anti-money laundering authorities and tax administrations. The objectives of this co-operation were to ensure that suspicious transaction reporting obligations were not undermined by the so-called ""fiscal excuse"" and to permit, to the fullest extent possible, the exchange of information between anti-money laundering and tax authorities without jeopardizing the effectiveness of anti-money laundering systems. On February 3, 2000, the FATF and OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs held a second informal contact meeting to consider the issue of cooperation between tax authorities and anti-money laundering authorities. While it was agreed that tax and anti-money laundering authorities have distinct priorities, work on cooperation issues will continue in the future.

One of the FATF's goals is to encourage co-operation with the private sector in the development of policies and programs to combat money laundering. To further this aim, a third Forum was convened on February 4, 2000 with representatives from the financial services industry and accounting professions(1). The purpose of this event was to discuss with the private sector, areas of common interest and the best way to develop measures to prevent and detect money laundering through the financial community. Four general topics were addressed in the Forum: current money laundering trends, feedback to institutions reporting suspicious transactions, the role of the accounting profession in identifying and discouraging money laundering and the issues raised by the wire transfers of funds.

(1) Representatives attended the Forum from FATF members, national banking, financial and accounting associations, and companies such as SWIFT and Western Union. Delegates from international financial services industry and accounting organizations (European Banking Federation, International Banking Security Association, European Insurance Committee, European Savings Banks Grouping, International Federation of Accountants, European Federation of Accountants and the Federation of European Stock Exchanges) also attended.

During the year, the Ad Hoc Group on Estimating the Magnitude of Money Laundering held several meetings, including a two-day Technical Workshop on estimating drug trafficking proceeds. As a result of this work, an expert consultant prepared a report to the Ad Hoc Group. The report examined a range of national and international efforts to quantify the value of illicit drug sales on either a global or national basis. The purpose of the study was to identify and assess alternative approaches for estimating total revenues generated annually by sales of cocaine, heroin and cannabis globally and in each of the 29 FATF members and observer members. Due to data and analytical constraints, the FATF decided to end this work at this stage. However, several international organizations and interested FATF members are continuing to work to improve the available data, and will also continue to work to address the problem.

Africa FATF-Style Bodies

Two FATF-style regional bodies are in various stages of development on the African continent:

Eastern and Southern African Anti-Money Laundering Group

Tanzanian authorities are working with other governments in the region to further develop the Eastern and Southern African Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG). The group was launched at a meeting of Ministers and high-level representatives in Arusha, Tanzania, in August 1999 and held its first meeting in April 2000. Following the signature of its Memorandum of Understanding by seven jurisdictions, the ESAAMLG came into formal existence. The group will maintain its Secretariat in Dar es Salaam. The ESAAMLG recently appointed its first secretary and early plans call for the group to study the impact of money laundering in the region and to produce a typologies report on arms trafficking and the cash economy.

Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda have now signed the ESAAMLG Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) and are considered members. Botswana and Zambia have both completed the necessary preparations to sign in the very near future. Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe are also nearing completion of preparatory work and are expected to sign the MOU at a later date. It is hoped that South Africa will also sign in the future. Work on an ESAAMLG web program is progressing with the designation of national contact points and the start of an effort to collect copies of relevant money laundering legislation. The group has established three standing subgroups (legal, financial and law enforcement) to begin dealing in more detail with anti-money laundering issues in each of these areas. Funding for the ESAAMLG is another major issue that still must be resolved for the group to be able to move forward.

Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering (GIABA)

The first meetings of GIABA(1), established by the December 1999 Decision of the Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), were held in Dakar, Senegal, in November 2000. GIABA members include: Benin, Cape Verde Islands, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo.

The meeting adopted the statutes and explored ways of financing the GIABA. The statutes endorse the Forty Recommendations, recognize the FATF as an observer and provide for self-assessment and mutual evaluation procedures to be carried out by GIABA. While the text prepared by the experts provided for a strong involvement of ECOWAS in the activities of GIABA, the Ministers agreed to give more autonomy to the new body. As an interim measure, Senegal offered to provide a provisional structure until the formal establishment of GIABA.

Essential issues such as the location of the headquarters and the selection of the Executive Secretary of GIABA were not discussed. However, one possibility considered in the margins of the meetings was to establish the Secretariat in Senegal (Dakar) and to appoint a representative from an English speaking country of the region (Nigeria was mentioned) as head of the Secretariat.

Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering

The Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) Secretariat is the focal point for APG activities. Currently the APG is comprised of nineteen members(2) from South Asia, Southeast and East Asia and the South Pacific. There are also seven observer jurisdictions(3) and thirteen observer international and regional organizations(4). The purpose of the APG is to ensure the adoption, implementation and enforcement of internationally accepted anti-money laundering standards as set out in the 40 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

(1) Groupe Intergouvernemental d'Action contre le Blanchiment en Afrique

(2) Australia, Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Fiji Islands, Hong Kong, China, Japan, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Republic of Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Republic of the Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United States of America, Vanuatu.

(3) Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cook Islands, Macau, China, Nepal, Burma, Vietnam.

(4) ASEAN Secretariat, Asian Development Bank, Commonwealth Secretariat, Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units of the World, Financial Action Task Force Secretariat, International Development Law Institute, International Monetary Fund, Interpol, Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors, South Pacific Forum Secretariat, United Nations Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, The World Bank, World Customs Organization.

During 2000, the APG held one plenary meeting in Sydney on May 31—June 2, 2000 hosted by Australia. The meeting resulted in an expansion of the APG Terms of Reference, which included distinctive membership criteria, a commitment to implementing the FATF 40 Recommendations, a budget for the APG Secretariat and a requirement that each APG member commit itself to a mutual evaluation. The APG also agreed on a strategic plan that includes, among other initiatives, self-assessment exercises, a training and technical assistance strategy and typologies workshops. This meeting also noted the enactment of anti-money laundering legislation in several jurisdictions. The next plenary meeting of the APG will be held May 22-24, 2001 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

In March 2000, the APG conducted its third typologies workshop in Bangkok, Thailand which received a report on underground banking and alternative remittance systems, examined the use of false identities for money laundering purposes and identified some other current money laundering methods being used in the region. The APG will continue and expand its typologies work in close consultation with the FATF and other regional bodies. The next APG Typologies Meeting will take place in Singapore in October 2001. There will also be a meeting of and report from the APG Working Group on Underground Banking and Alternative Remittance Systems.

An extremely positive development was the APG's commencement of a mutual evaluation program. At the Sydney meeting, the APG approved its first mutual evaluation report (of Vanuatu), which was jointly conducted with the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors (OGBS). The APG has scheduled four mutual evaluations (Labuan Offshore Financial Center, Samoa, Taiwan and Macau) to be conducted during 2001. A mutual evaluation training project, funded by the U.S. Government, will also be conducted in early 2001 to increase the skills needed in the region to conduct mutual evaluations.

Because of the particular vulnerability of offshore financial centers to misuse by money launderers, the APG Secretariat has devoted extensive time and effort in the Pacific region in the last 12 months. With extensive assistance from the United States, New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, a project to establish a regional Financial Intelligence Unit was launched. On March 13-28, 2000, a multinational assessment team visited the jurisdictions that expressed support for this initiative, mainly Fiji, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Samoa. The first task in the project will be to assist Pacific jurisdictions to establish domestic FIUs. The second task will be a project assessment of the regional financial intelligence unit. The outcome of this work has been an agreement that South Pacific jurisdictions will establish domestic FIUs. Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Samoa have already done so. Fiji and several other jurisdictions are in the process of doing so.

The APG has adopted a detailed technical assistance and training strategy to provide necessary assistance to its members covering the legal, financial and law enforcement sectors. The APG has entered a number of joint arrangements with other organizations in this regard. However there is a greater demand than current resources can meet. As a consequence, the APG is asking for assistance from the FATF and from other bodies to provide funding and expertise in order to effectively execute the technical assistance and training strategy. Throughout 2000, the APG Secretariat has either directly provided or arranged for the provision of assistance and training to many countries in the region, including Thailand, Malaysia, Samoa, Pakistan, Indonesia, Fiji, the Philippines, Vanuatu and Sri Lanka.

Caribbean Financial Action Task Force

The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), a FATF-style regional body comprised of 25 jurisdictions(1), continues to advance its anti-money laundering initiatives within the Caribbean basin. In October 2000, Aruba assumed the Chairmanship of the CFATF, succeeding the British Virgin Islands. The Dominican Republic assumed the Deputy Chair.

(1) CFATF members include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, the Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Turks and Caicos Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.

Members of the CFATF subscribe to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that delineates the CFATF's mission, objectives, and membership requirements. All members are required to make a political commitment to adhere to and implement the 40 Recommendations of the FATF, as well as the CFATF's additional 19 Recommendations, and to undergo peer review in the form of mutual evaluations to assess their level of implementation of the Recommendations. Members are also required to contribute to the CFATF budget and to participate in the activities of the body.

In addition to members, the CFATF MOU also provides for other categories of participation in the organization. In October 2000, Mexico was welcomed as the newest Cooperating and Supporting Nation (COSUN) of the CFATF (joining Canada, France, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States), bringing the number of COSUNs to seven. COSUNs are expected to provide support to the CFATF. Haiti was admitted to the CFATF as an observer member and the World Customs Organization was welcomed as an observer organization.

The CFATF completed its first round of mutual evaluation on-site visits during the year 2000. All CFATF members, except Nicaragua, have undergone mutual evaluation visits. Five mutual evaluation reports were adopted by the CFATF Council during 2000—Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Venezuela. Mutual evaluation reports on Anguilla, Belize, and Suriname are expected to be discussed, finalized, and adopted during 2001, at which point the first round of evaluations will be complete. In May 2001, the CFATF plans to conduct a mutual evaluation training seminar in preparation for its second round of evaluations, which will be based on the revised 1996 40 Recommendations, and will also incorporate the FATF's 25 criteria for Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories. These second round evaluations are scheduled to commence in July 2001.

All member contributions have been paid with the exception of arrears owed by Nicaragua. Due to Nicaragua's lack of participation in the CFATF and non-payment of its arrears, a decision was taken by the CFATF Council to suspend Nicaragua's membership in the CFATF in March 2001, if Nicaragua does not address these outstanding issues.

In October 2000, the CFATF conducted the first part of a two-part typologies exercise on free trade zones and money laundering. Part two of the exercise will be conducted in March 2001 and a report with recommendations to address the money laundering vulnerabilities of free trade zones will be issued. In December 2000, the CFATF held a conference on the international financial services sector, attended by both public and private sector participants. The conference was designed to educate participants on money laundering vulnerabilities of the international financial services sector, as well as measures that can be taken to reduce money laundering risks in the sector.

Council of Europe

The Council of Europe's Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (PC-R-EV)(1) has achieved significant progress since its creation in 1997. Its first round of mutual evaluation on-site visits has been completed, and all but two of the mutual evaluation reports have been finalized and adopted. The final two reports (on Georgia and Albania) will be discussed by the PC-R-EV plenary at its next meeting to be held in June 2001.

(1) PC-R-EV members include Albania, Andorra, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.

Two PC-R-EV plenary meetings were conducted during 2000. At the February 2000 meeting, mutual evaluation reports on Liechtenstein, Poland and Romania were adopted and a typologies exercise focusing on organized crime and money laundering was conducted. At the PC-R-EV's June meeting, mutual evaluation reports on Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were adopted.

A mutual evaluation training seminar for examiners was conducted in Lisbon, Portugal in November 2000, in preparation for the PC-R-EV's second round of evaluations, planned to commence June 2001. The seminar focused on the experiences of the first round of evaluations and priorities for the second round.

At the plenary meeting of the PC-R-EV held January 15-19, 2001, mutual evaluation reports on Latvia, the Russian Federation, San Marino, and Ukraine were adopted. The plenary also agreed that the FATF's 25 criteria to identify non-cooperative countries and territories would be considered in assessing members' anti-money laundering regimes during the PC-R-EV's second round of mutual evaluations.

European Union

The European Union (EU) is currently proposing revisions to its anti-money laundering Directive (Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991). The Directive covers issues on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering. The EU is considering imposing anti-money laundering obligations on ""gatekeepers."" The modifications under consideration would require a broad range of professionals (including independent legal professionals, accountants, auditors, and notaries) to abide by anti-money laundering rules. The rules would apply when professionals assist in the planning or execution of certain transactions or act on behalf of their clients in the conduct of certain financial or commercial activities. If this amendment is endorsed by the European Parliament, the 15 member states of the EU will be required to bring their domestic laws into conformity with the new provisions of the Directive.

The following is a draft text currently being considered:

Member states shall ensure that the obligations laid down in this Directive are imposed on the following institutions: . . .

1. notaries and other independent legal professionals, when they participate, whether:

(a) by assisting in the planning or execution of transactions for their client concerning the

(i) buying and selling of real property or business entities;

(ii) managing of client money, securities or other assets;

(iii) opening or management of bank, savings or securities accounts;

(iv) organization of contributions necessary for the creation, operation or management of companies

(b) or by acting on behalf of and for their client in any financial or real estate transaction

Financial Action Task Force Against Money Laundering in South America

The Memorandum of Understanding establishing the South American Financial Action Task Force, (Grupo de Acci�n Financiera de Sudamerica Contra el Lavado de Activos-GAFISUD) was signed on December 8, 2000 by nine member states, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay. In addition, the Organization of American States' Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) is a special member of GAFISUD.

In addition, the Inter-American Development Bank, Canada, Portugal, Spain and the United States all attended the first meeting of GAFISUD. At this meeting Spain applied for and was granted official observer status with the organization, and the other attendees are considering joining as observers as well.

Colombia was elected to be the first President of the organization for a one-year term. In addition Colombia will serve as the provisional Executive Secretariat until the next meeting of GAFISUD, which is scheduled to be held in May 2001 in Uruguay.

GAFISUD is a FATF-style regional body committed to the adoption and implementation of the FATF's 40 Recommendations, a program of self assessment and mutual evaluations of its members.

OAS/CICAD

During 2000, the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) carried out three major initiatives related to combating money laundering:

Initiating a peer review process including indicators of progress in implementation of ""members"" anti-money laundering programs;
Provided training to several member states in various aspects of anti-money laundering that will best assist states in implementation of the Buenos Aires Communiqu�; and
Participating in the development of the South American Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FAFISUD).

Work on the peer review process concerning antidrug policies and activities of member states including related activities such as money laundering control under the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM) continued on schedule throughout the year. The first round of evaluations of all 34 OAS/CICAD member countries began in the first half of 2000 and concluded in December 2000. The results will be presented to the Summit of the Americas meeting scheduled to take place in Quebec City, Canada in May 2001. Additionally, the Group of Experts to Control Money Laundering proposed that CICAD use the information derived from the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism to evaluate the money laundering situation in the Hemisphere. It was also proposed that they develop policies in order to take into account recent developments not anticipated in the Plan of Action of Buenos Aires.

Many anti-money laundering training activities have been carried out during 2000, including, the culmination of the CICAD-Inter American Development Bank (IDB) Pilot Project to train officials of banking regulatory organizations and financial entities. This Project was carried out in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay between April and December 2000. The follow-up stage of this program has begun in these countries by means of a web page created by CICAD for providing updated information and for consultation purposes. Additionally, training courses for judges, prosecutors and officials of the Financial Intelligence Units were designed during the year, and the IDB has committed funds to support courses for judges and prosecutors.

As a result of an agreement between the National Drug Plan of Spain and CICAD, a course on the control and investigation of money laundering has begun. This one-week course will be given every six months. It is divided into four modules, the first of which was carried out in Antigua and Barbuda and Guatemala from May 29 to June 2. The second module of the course was held in Cartagena, Colombia in November 10-17 and addressed the control and investigation of money laundering.

With respect to the Regional Centre for Legal Cooperation and Development in Central America, two courses on the prevention of money laundering were carried out in August and October in Panama and Honduras, respectively. A round-table session of judges, prosecutors and legislators will be held in Costa Rica in the first quarter of 2000 to endeavor to reach agreements on how to develop laws in areas where legal deficiencies have impeded better money laundering controls.

Finally, in regard to course participation, representatives of CICAD gave presentations at the ""First Latin American Conference in Money Laundering"" organized by Alert Global Media, which took place in Buenos Aires in October. Representatives also participated at a Regional Seminar held in Lima, Peru in November for the Andean countries organized by the United Nations Office of Drug Control Programs and the French Police Force.

The United Nations

UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime

The UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Convention), signed by 125 countries including the United States at a high-level signing conference December 12-14 in Palermo, Italy, is the first legally binding multilateral treaty specifically targeting transnational organized crime. Two supplemental Protocols addressing trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling were also signed in Palermo. Each instrument requires 40 states to become parties before it can enter into force.

The Convention takes aim at preventing and combating transnational organized crime through a common toolkit of criminal law techniques and international cooperation. It requires states parties to have laws criminalizing the most prevalent types of criminal conduct associated with organized crime groups, including money laundering, obstruction of justice, corruption of public officials and conspiracy. The article on money laundering requires parties to institute a comprehensive domestic regulatory and supervisory regime for banks and financial institutions to deter and detect money laundering. The regime will have to emphasize requirements for customer identification, record keeping and reporting of suspicious transactions.

United Nations Global Programme against Money Laundering (GPML)

The United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP), through its Global Program Against Money Laundering (GPML), serves a unique function as the only global international organization providing comprehensive anti-money laundering training and technical assistance. Its programs extend to legislators, law enforcement officials, prosecutors and judges, regulators, bankers and providers of other financial services. GPML's mission is to use this capacity to provide practical, results-oriented assistance, in close cooperation with its other international partners, that will help countries and jurisdictions achieve compliance with the full range of international anti-money laundering standards.

Key to achieving this objective in 2000 was the GPML Forum (formerly the UN Offshore Forum), which was launched at a Plenary meeting in the Cayman Islands on March 30-31. The Forum brought together 35 offshore jurisdictions, hoping to secure their commitment to the international standards and norms that have emerged in the last decade from the United Nations, FATF, the OECD, the Basel Committee, IOSCO and others. Some 33 OFCs, subsequently lodged letters of political commitment with the United Nations to adhere to international standards and norms. These requests for assistance will help determine the direction of GPML's technical assistance priorities for some time to come and will result in greater demands on the GPML's and the United Nations' technical assistance capacities and its fiscal resources.

GPML's cooperation with the Government of Israel in 1999 and 2000 is now serving as one of the models for its future technical assistance efforts. Israel passed anti-money laundering legislation on August 2, 2000 after working closely with the United Nations for over a year on the drafting, and on the development of other anti-money laundering institutions. GPML's own lawyers cooperated with their Israeli counterparts on drafting the laws, offering the UN model legislation as a foundation but working towards provisions appropriate to the individual requirements of Israel's legal system. GPML also brought in experts to advise on structuring a financial intelligence unit that would function well with Israel's existing institutions, and organized seminars in the Knesset and with the private sector to inform legislators and business people about what the new mechanisms would demand of them.

Many other jurisdictions have also turned to the United Nations, either individually or as part of a sub-regional grouping. They include the Bahamas, Dominica, Liechtenstein, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and Grenadines. In light of this, GPML is planning to expand its highly successful mentoring program, which offers longer term on-site assistance to countries. In 2000, GPML placed mentors in Barbados and Jamaica, using expertise provided by AUSTRAC, the Australian FIU, and in Antigua and Barbuda.

GPML plans to continue its focus on assistance aimed at developing successful financial intelligence units (FIUs) and, in particular, on the development of regional FIUs, where appropriate. Considerable preparatory work on the Eastern Caribbean regional FIU was already underway in 2000, in partnership with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). GPML also supported regional approaches to anti-money laundering by coordinating sub-regional workshops for the Gulf States and the Andean sub-region.

Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism

On December 9, 1999, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. It was opened for signature from January 10, 2000 to December 31, 2001. This Convention requires parties to criminalize the provision or collection of funds with the intent that they be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, to conduct certain terrorist activity. Article 18 of the Convention requires states parties to cooperate in the prevention of terrorist financing by adapting their domestic legislation, if necessary, to prevent and counter preparations in their respective territories for the commission of offenses specified in Article 2. To that end, Article 18 encourages implementation of numerous measures also included among the FATF's 40 Recommendations. These measures, which states parties may implement at their discretion, include: prohibiting accounts held by or benefiting people unidentified or unidentifiable; verifying the identity of the real parties to transactions; and requiring financial institutions to verify the existence and the structure of the customer by obtaining proof of incorporation.

The Convention also encourages states parties to obligate financial institutions to report complex or large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions which have no apparent economic or lawful purpose, without incurring criminal or civil liability for good faith reporting; to require financial institutions to maintain records for five years; to supervise (for example, through licensing) money-transmission agencies; and to monitor the physical cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. Finally, the Convention addresses information exchange, including through the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). As of January 29, 2001, 37 states had signed the Convention, including the United States. It will enter into force on the thirtieth day after 22 states have become parties.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision(1), part of the Bank for International Settlements, issued in January 2001, a consultative paper on customer due diligence for banks. The paper is part of an ongoing effort by the Basel Committee to strengthen risk management procedures in banks throughout the world. In developing the consultative paper, the Basel Committee determined that many countries around the world have not developed basic supervisory practices with regard to money laundering and other financial crimes and look to the Basel Committee for guidance in these areas. The consultative paper, once adopted by national supervisors, will provide the framework for national supervisory standards with regard to customer due diligence. The consultative paper sets forth guidance for national banking supervisors to establish minimum standards and internal controls to ensure that banks know with whom they are doing business. The essential elements for customer due diligence, as set forth in the paper, include customer acceptance polices, customer identification, monitoring of high-risk accounts and risk management.

(1) The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is a Committee of banking supervisory authorities which was established by the central bank Governors of the Group of Ten countries in 1975. It consists of senior representatives of banking supervisory authorities and central banks from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.

Financial Intelligence Units and the Egmont Group

The fight against money laundering has been an essential part of the overall struggle to combat illegal narcotics trafficking and the activities of organized crime. The measures governments have developed to counter money laundering can also help stem corruption, terrorist financing, and other serious crime. Banks and other financial institutions are an important source for information about money laundering and other financial crimes.

In the 1990s, governments around the world began to work together to mitigate the corrosive dangers that unchecked financial crimes posed to their economic and political systems. To address this threat, many governments created specialized agencies to deal with the problem of money laundering. In the beginning, there was no unifying concept of what functions these agencies should perform, and it was almost by accident that they had in common the function of receiving and processing financial disclosures. At about this time, the heads of these organizations began to become visible on national delegations at various international meetings and conferences. Through these informal contacts, they shared common experiences and determined that it might be useful to meet and discuss these commonalties. These first contacts led to a meeting on June 9, 1995 at the Egmont-Arenberg Palace in Brussels, Belgium to discuss financial intelligence units or FIUs. Chaired jointly by FinCEN and the Cellule de Traitement des Informations Financieres (CTIF) of Belgium, the meeting in Brussels enabled participants to become acquainted with the already existing FIUs (14 nations) and to open communication channels. Now known as the Egmont Group, these FIUs meet yearly to find ways to cooperate, especially in the areas of information exchange, training, and the sharing of expertise.

During the Egmont Plenary in November 1996, in Rome, the Egmont Group came to an agreement on the definition of an FIU. Financial Intelligence Units are centralized agencies that, at a minimum, receive, analyze, and disclose to competent authorities information provided by financial institutions (and other mandated entities) concerning possible money laundering and other financial crimes. FIUs offer law enforcement agencies around the world an important new avenue for information collection and exchange.

The Egmont Group as a whole meets once a year, and working groups (Legal, Training/Communications, and Outreach) meet three times a year to discuss issues related to money laundering and to conduct business. These working groups consist of a Chair, Vice-Chair and other working representatives from FIU members who serve on a voluntary basis.

The Legal Working Group has focused its efforts on issues related to information exchange between FIUs.

The Training/Communications Working Group looks at ways to communicate more effectively, identifies training opportunities for FIU personnel and examines new software applications that might facilitate the analytical work of these personnel. Other significant programs developed by this working group are the FIU personnel exchange programs and the topical/regional workshops hosted by various FIUs. Exchanges and workshops between FIUs have occurred all over the globe with good results. Another major initiative of the Training/Communications Working Group was the co-hosting of an FIU training seminar for analysts in January 2001. All FIUs, as well as countries working toward creating FIUs, were invited to participate in this first major Egmont training opportunity in which over 120 analysts participated.

It is also via this working group that changes and enhancements are identified for the Egmont Secure Web. It has long been recognized that feedback to the various financial institutions and other entities required to report suspicious or unusual transactions was lacking. In order to attempt to provide a document to show the utility in reporting suspicious/unusual transactions, the Training/Communications Working Group undertook a major project in 2000 to compile a booklet of successful money laundering cases from around the world. It is expected that the booklet will be available to all FIUs in early 2001.

The Outreach Working Group works to create a global network of FIUs to facilitate international cooperation. The Outreach Working Group has identified countries that the Egmont Group should approach to offer to assist in the development of FIUs. These have been categorized into short, medium and long-term FIU development projects for the Outreach Working Group.

The Egmont Group has no secretariat. Administrative functions are shared by FIUs on a rotating basis. Currently, the Dutch MOT has assumed this function.

There are currently 53 operational FIU units worldwide, with many others in various stages of development. FIUs operate in: Aruba, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Japan, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela.

During the plenary meeting in May 2000, five new jurisdictions (bolded above) joined the Egmont roster. One of the main goals of the Egmont Group is to create a global network of FIUs to facilitate international cooperation. Although FIUs operate differently, FIUs exchange information with their counterparts under certain specific conditions. This information could be suspicious or unusual transaction reports from the financial sector as well as government administrative data and public record information. Many FIUs can be of assistance in providing financial intelligence rapidly to other FIUs. One of the most significant accomplishments of the group's efforts has been the creation of a secure Internet web site. Egmont's International Secure Web System (ESW)-developed primarily by FinCEN-permits members of the group to communicate with one another via secure e-mail, posting and assessing information regarding trends, analytical tools, and technological developments. In other words, this system provides the ability to facilitate practical, rapid exchanges of information that could enhance the efforts of the fight against money laundering. FinCEN, on behalf of the Egmont Group, maintains the Egmont Secure Web. Currently, there are 34 FIUs connected to the ESW.

The ongoing development and establishment of FIUs exemplify how countries around the world continue to intensify their efforts to focus on research, analysis and information exchange in order to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.

Money Laundering Comparative Table

Each year, U.S. officials from agencies with anti-money laundering responsibilities meet to assess the money laundering situations in more than 175 jurisdictions. The review includes an assessment of the significance of financial transactions in the country's financial institutions that involve proceeds of serious crime, steps taken or not taken to address financial crime and money laundering, each jurisdiction's vulnerability to money laundering, the conformance of its laws and policies to international standards, the effectiveness with which the government has acted, and the government's political will to take needed actions.

The 2000 INCSR assigned priorities to jurisdictions using a classification system consisting of three differential categories titled Jurisdictions of Primary Concern, Jurisdictions of Concern, and Other Jurisdictions Monitored.

INCSR priorities draw upon a number of factors which include: (1) whether the country's financial institutions engage in transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from serious crime; (2) the extent to which the jurisdiction is or remains vulnerable to money laundering, notwithstanding its money laundering countermeasures, if any; (3) the nature and extent of the money laundering situation in each jurisdiction (for example, whether it involves drugs or other contraband); (4) the ways in which the U.S. regards the situation as having international ramifications; (5) the situation's impact on U.S. interests; (6) whether the jurisdiction has taken appropriate legislative actions to address specific problems; (7) whether there is a lack of licensing and oversight of offshore financial centers and businesses; (8) whether the jurisdiction's laws are being effectively implemented; and (9) where U.S. interests are involved, the degree of cooperation between the foreign government and U.S. government agencies. There are approximately two dozen sub-factors that are also considered. These sub-factors (Category Criteria) are explained below.

A government (e.g., the U.S. or the UK) can have comprehensive laws on its books and conduct aggressive anti-money laundering enforcement efforts but still be classified a ""Primary Concern"" jurisdiction. In some cases, this classification may simply or largely be a function of the size of the jurisdiction's economy. In such jurisdictions, the volume of money laundering is likely to be substantial, necessitating quick, continuous and effective anti-money laundering efforts by the government. ""Primary Concern"" jurisdictions will therefore likely receive priority attention from the United States. While the threat from jurisdictions classified ""Concern"" is not as acute, they too must undertake efforts to develop or enhance their anti-money laundering regimes. Finally, while jurisdictions in the ""Other"" category do not pose an immediate concern, it will nevertheless be important to monitor their money laundering situations because, under the right circumstances, virtually any jurisdiction of any size can develop into a significant money laundering center.

Category Criteria

The current ability of money launderers to penetrate virtually any financial system makes every jurisdiction a potential money laundering center. There is no precise measure of vulnerability for any financial system; but a checklist of what drug money managers reportedly look for provides a basic guide. The checklist includes:

Failure to criminalize money laundering for all serious crimes or limiting the offense to narrow predicates.
Rigid bank secrecy rules that obstruct law enforcement investigations or that prohibit or inhibit large value and/or suspicious or unusual transaction reporting by both banks and non-bank financial institutions.
Lack of or inadequate ""know your client"" requirements to open accounts or conduct financial transactions, including the permitted use of anonymous, nominee, numbered or trustee accounts.
No requirement to disclose the beneficial owner of an account or the true beneficiary of a transaction.
Lack of effective monitoring of cross-border currency movements.
No reporting requirements for large cash transactions.
No requirement to maintain financial records over a specific period of time.
No mandatory requirement to report suspicious transactions or a pattern of inconsistent reporting under a voluntary system; lack of uniform guidelines for identifying suspicious transactions.
Use of bearer monetary instruments.
Well-established non-bank financial systems, especially where regulation, supervision, and monitoring are absent or lax.
Patterns of evasion of exchange controls by legitimate businesses.
Ease of incorporation, especially where ownership can be held through nominees or bearer shares, or where off-the-shelf corporations can be acquired.
No central reporting unit for receiving, analyzing and disseminating to the competent authorities information on large value, suspicious or unusual financial transactions that might identify possible money laundering activity.
Lack of or weak bank regulatory controls, or failure to adopt or adhere to the Basle Principles for International Banking Supervision, especially in jurisdictions where the monetary or bank supervisory authority is understaffed, underskilled or uncommitted.
Well-established offshore financial centers or tax-haven banking systems, especially jurisdictions where such banks and accounts can be readily established with minimal background investigations.
Extensive foreign banking operations, especially where there is significant wire transfer activity or multiple branches of foreign banks, or limited audit authority over foreign-owned banks or institutions.
Limited asset seizure or confiscation authority.
Limited narcotics, money laundering and financial crime enforcement and lack of trained investigators or regulators.
Jurisdictions with free trade zones where there is little government presence or other supervisory authority.
Patterns of official corruption or a laissez-faire attitude toward the business and banking communities.
Jurisdictions where the U.S. dollar is readily accepted, especially jurisdictions where banks and other financial institutions allow dollar deposits.
Well-established access to international bullion trading centers in New York, Istanbul, Zurich, Dubai and Mumbai.
Jurisdictions where there is significant trade in or export of gems, particularly diamonds.
Jurisdictions with large parallel or black market economies.
Limited or no ability to share financial information with foreign law enforcement authorities.

Comparative Chart

The comparative chart that follows the Glossary of Terms below identifies the broad range of actions that jurisdictions have, or have not, taken to combat money laundering, that were effective as of December 31, 2000. This reference chart provides a comparison of elements that define legislative activity and identify other characteristics that can have a relationship to money laundering vulnerability. Where there is no (or only fragmentary) information regarding specific categories, the corresponding cells on the chart have been left blank.

Comparative Chart

Country Reports

Afghanistan (Other). Afghanistan has no formal credit institutions, and its financial institutions are rudimentary. Afghanistan is not considered a center for money laundering. However, Afghanistan does play a key role in the heroin trade. The proceeds of heroin trafficking generally are laundered in other countries, or through the hawala alternative remittance system. Reports indicate that the Taliban and other factions in Afghanistan are involved in narcotics trafficking. The private investment of drug profits reportedly has fueled a surge in construction and commercial activity in Kandahar City in recent years.

Afghanistan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Albania (Concern). Albania is at significant risk to money laundering because it is a transit country for trafficking in narcotics, arms, contraband, and illegal aliens. Organized crime groups use Albania as a base of operations for conducting criminal activities in other countries. The proceeds from these activities are easily laundered in Albania because of official corruption and weak government controls.

Albania criminalized all forms of money laundering through Article 287 of the Albanian Criminal Code of 1995. In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assisted Albania in drafting anti-money laundering legislation that was subsequently approved by Albania's legislature. The law reportedly would establish an agency to coordinate the Government of Albania's (GOA) efforts to detect and prevent money laundering. This agency will fall under the control of the Ministry of Finance and will evaluate reports filed by financial institutions. If the agency suspects that a transaction involves the proceeds of criminal activity, it must forward the information to the prosecutor's office.

The legislation would also require financial institutions to report to the anti-money laundering agency all transactions that exceed approximately US $10,000. Financial institutions would be required to report transactions within 48 hours if the origin of the money cannot be determined. In addition, private and state entities would be required to report all financial transactions that exceed certain thresholds.

In December 2000, Albania signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Albania is a member of the Council of Europe (COE) Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (PC-R-EV).

The GOA should enact and fully implement the provisions of its anti-money laundering legislation. In particular, the GOA should provide adequate resources and support to the new anti-money laundering agency.

Algeria (Other). Algeria is not a financial center, and currently there is no available information suggesting that money laundering is a significant problem there. However, the Algerian government has not enacted anti-money laundering legislation nor does it have in place any procedures such as a suspicious transaction reporting system to detect money laundering. Individuals entering Algeria must declare all foreign currency, but it remains unclear how strictly this is enforced.

Algeria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Angola (Other). Money laundering does not appear to be a significant problem in Angola because of its poorly developed financial sector. However, Angola does not have in place a set of comprehensive laws, regulations, and other procedures to detect money laundering and financial crime. Angola's counternarcotics laws criminalize money laundering related to drug trafficking.

In December 2000, Angola signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Anguilla (Other). Anguilla has a small but growing offshore financial sector that renders it vulnerable to money laundering. As with the other United Kingdom Caribbean Overseas Territories, Anguilla underwent a thorough evaluation of its financial regulations in 2000, co-sponsored by the local and British governments.

Anguilla's domestic financial sector includes four domestic banks and 17 insurance companies. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) supervises Anguilla's four domestic banks. The offshore sector includes two banks, one captive insurance company, and approximately 2000 international business companies (IBCs) and 43 trusts. IBCs may be registered using bearer shares that conceal the identity of the beneficial owner of these entities.

In 2000, Anguilla enacted several pieces of legislation to improve its anti-money laundering regime. The Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act (PCCA) 2000 extends the predicate offenses for money laundering to all indictable offenses. It provides for suspicious activity reporting and a safe harbor for this reporting. The Money Laundering Reporting Authority Act (MLRA) 2000 requires persons involved in the provision of financial services to report any suspicious transactions derived from drugs or criminal conduct. It also details provisions for a Reporting Authority that will receive the suspicious transaction reports required and may forward information to the police for further investigation. The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) (Anguilla) Act 2000 enables Anguilla to directly cooperate with other jurisdictions through mutual legal assistance.

Anguilla is subject to the US/UK MLAT and the US/UK extradition treaty. Anguilla is a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), and through the UK, is subject to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

Anguilla has developed important legal tools for detecting and investigating money laundering and other financial crimes. It should move quickly to implement provisions of the PCCA and the MLRA and establish a Reporting Authority that can easily cooperate with foreign authorities. Anguilla should also adopt consider measures to ensure complete identification of beneficial owners of IBCs so that international criminals do not use these entities to perpetuate financial crimes.

Antigua and Barbuda (Primary). Although Antigua and Barbuda remains vulnerable to money laundering because of its offshore financial sector and its internet gaming industry, it has made significant progress toward improving the regulation of the offshore financial sector since the US Treasury Department issued an advisory to US financial institutions in April 1999. In its advisory the Treasury Department recommended ""enhanced scrutiny to all financial transactions routed into or out of Antigua and Barbuda"" because of 1998 amendments that had seriously weakened Antigua and Barbuda's anti-money laundering regime. The United Kingdom (UK) also issued a bank advisory at that time and France publicly expressed it concerns.

In response to this international action, in 1999 the Government of Antigua and Barbuda (GOAB) repealed those amendments to the Money-Laundering (Prevention) Act (MLPA) of 1996 that had effectively strengthened bank secrecy, inhibited money laundering investigations and infringed on international cooperation. Additionally, in 2000 the GOAB amended the International Business Corporations Act (IBCA) of 1982 in order to excise the 1998 amendments that had given the International Financial Sector Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) responsibility to market and regulate the offshore sector, as well as to allow members of the IFSRA Board of Directors to maintain ties to the offshore industry.

In August 2000, the GOAB again amended the IBCA to require resident agents to ensure the accuracy of the records and registers that are kept at the Registrar's office, and to know the names of beneficial owners of IBC's and to disclose such information to authorities upon request. Furthermore, in December 2000 the GOAB issued a Statutory Instrument, which has the force of law, requiring banks to establish the true identities of account holders and to verify the nature of an account holder's business, source of funds and beneficiaries. The GOAB has also drafted an International Trusts Bill and a Mutual Funds Bill.

The GOAB has established and staffed the Supervisory Authority (SA) within the ONDCP as mandated by the MLPA, and has issued regulations that implement its suspicious transactions reporting system. According to an Antiguan official, by year's end Antiguan and Barbudian financial institutions had filed a total of between ten and twenty suspicious transaction reports (STRs).

During 1999 and 2000, the GOAB conducted an extensive review of the offshore banking sector. As a result, 21 offshore banks had their licenses revoked, were dissolved, were placed in receivership, or were otherwise put out of business. Currently, Antigua and Barbuda has 26 licensed offshore banks of which only 18 are currently in operation and in good standing.

Like most of the other countries in the Eastern Caribbean, GOAB does not have a unified regulatory structure or uniform supervisory practices for its financial services sector. This is due to the fact that the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) supervises Antigua and Barbuda's domestic banking sector, conducting both on-site and off-site reviews of the country's financial institutions. Examiners review information related to savings and demand deposits during on-site inspections. To date, the ECCB has not begun supervising offshore banks.

The IFSRA issues licenses for the offshore sector, including the issuance of licenses for offshore banks and international business corporations, of which there are approximately 12,000. The license application requires disclosure of the names and addresses of directors-who must be natural persons-the activities the corporation intends to engage in, and the names of shareholders and number of shares that they will hold. Additionally, the IFSRA is responsible for the supervision of the offshore banking sector. IFSRA is currently increasing its staff in order to effectively perform on-site and off-site examinations of licensed offshore banks. To date, IFSRA has not performed any on-site examinations.

In October 2000, a joint US and UK interagency team visited Antigua and Barbuda to review the GOAB's progress in enacting and implementing legislation that addresses the issues raised in the 1999 US and UK advisories. As a result the UK subsequently issued a statement announcing modification of its advisory which reads in part:

HM Treasury recognizes the considerable effort that the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has made since April 1999 to strengthen the system of supervision and control, with a particular view to strengthening anti-money laundering systems. Although it is too early to judge whether these new systems have been fully successful, it is clear that there has been a step-change in the culture of combating money laundering in the Government and supervisory structures. But as has been recognized by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda, there is still room for further improvement before the jurisdiction meets the highest standards of international anti-money laundering laws and practice.

While waiting for the new systems to bed down, and the final legislative changes to be made, the UK still believes that financial institutions should continue to undertake additional due diligence when accepting new business from the financial institutions in Antigua and Barbuda. In particular, UK financial institutions should be aware of concerns that there are serious risks associated with involvement in transactions linked to the offshore gaming industry.

The report of the US members of the assessment team and recommendations regarding the US advisory are pending.

During 2000, the GOAB continued its bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various criminal and civil investigations and prosecutions. The GOAB has provided substantial assistance to US law enforcement and prosecutors investigating and prosecuting fraud and money laundering cases involving Antiguan-licensed American International Bank, European Union Bank and European Federal Credit Bank. As a result of Operation Risky Business, an FBI and US Customs Service investigation in which 19 individuals were convicted for fraud and money laundering, a request for the extradition of Antiguan citizen William Cooper, who assisted in the establishment of Antiguan-licensed Caribbean American Bank, was made in 1999. The request is currently pending in the Antiguan courts. In 1999, the GOAB charged former Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko with money laundering and froze approximately $83 million in alleged fraud proceeds that had been deposited in European Federal Credit Bank. This money was ultimately forfeited by an Antiguan court in 2000, but the court's decision has been appealed. Lazarenko is currently in US custody awaiting trial on money laundering charges filed in the Northern District of California.

Casinos and sports book-wagering operations in the Free Trade Zone are regulated and supervised by the Directorate of Offshore Gaming (DOG) and are required to incorporate under the IBCA. The DOG has issued Internet Gaming Technical Standards and guidelines; however, it is not clear whether these standards and guidelines are mandatory. Moreover, it is not clear if casinos and other gaming-related entities are subject to provisions of the IBCA or the MLPB. The GOAB is considering legislation and has drafted ""Regulations for the Licencing of Interactive Gaming And Interactive Wagering in Antigua and Barbuda"" to address possible money laundering through client accounts of Internet gambling operations.

Antigua and Barbuda is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering, and the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). In 1999, Antigua and Barbuda became the first country in the eastern Caribbean to exchange the instruments of ratification to bring into force Mutual Legal Assistance and Extradition Treaties with the United States Government.

During the last two years, the GOAB has shown a clear commitment to the creation of a legal and regulatory anti-money laundering regime that will meet international standards. The GOAB is urged to fully implement and enforce all provisions of its anti-money laundering legislation. Moreover, the GOAB must ensure that its gambling sector is covered by anti-money laundering legislation and that it is adequately supervised.

Argentina (Concern). High-profile regional investigations have produced evidence that Mexican and Colombian drug cartels are infiltrating Argentina's banking sector, which is the sector most affected by money laundering activities. It is believed that contraband and bribery also contribute to the money laundering occurring in Argentina, and that the use of companies, shell companies, trusts, financial advisors, accountants and notaries facilitate money laundering.

New money laundering legislation, Law 25.246, was passed in May 2000. While the October 1989 law applied only to the proceeds of illicit drug trafficking activities, the new law extends the money laundering offenses to include all existing crimes in the Penal Code and makes it a crime to launder proceeds of crimes committed in other countries. The new law sets a stricter regulatory framework for banks and a wide range of other entities. Under previous central bank regulations, the requirements for record-keeping customer identification, recording of cash transactions over US $10,000, and reporting of suspicious transactions applied only to banks, financial companies, credit unions, savings institutions, credit card issuers and money exchange dealers. Law 25.246 expands the customer identification, record-keeping and suspicious transactions reporting to a wide range of entities including foreign exchange houses, money remitters, gambling outlets, exporters/importers of jewels and precious metals, property registration agents, stock brokers, insurance companies, art dealers, notaries, accountants, and travelers' checks companies. The law forbids these financial and commercial entities to notify their clients of the filing of suspicious financial transaction reports, and provides a safe harbor from liability for reporting the transactions.

To aid Argentina in its fight against money laundering, Law 25.246 creates a financial intelligence unit (FIU), an autonomous agency under the administration of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights responsible for receiving, analyzing and disseminating to the Office of the Attorney General information to prevent and impede money laundering. The FIU is not yet operational.

One money laundering case is currently being prosecuted under the 1989 legislation.

Argentina is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Argentina is an active participant in international anti-money laundering groups. Following their September 1999 admission as an observer member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Argentina underwent an evaluation by the FATF in early 2000 and became a full member in June 2000. Argentina is a member of the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering. Argentina also played a leading role in the creation of the South American Financial Action Task Force in December 2000. Argentina and the United States have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty that entered into force in 1993.

The government of Argentina is encouraged to issue implementing regulations for Law 25.2456, and make its FIU operational as soon as possible to enable it to participate in the Egmont Group. This will enable it to cooperate more comprehensively in domestic and international efforts to combat money laundering.

Armenia (Other). Armenia is not a major financial center, however its status as a transit country for narcotics trafficking and smuggling, combined with lax border controls, creates a favorable money-laundering environment. High unemployment, low salaries, corruption, a large underground economy, and the presence of organized crime also increase Armenia's vulnerability to money laundering. Armenian authorities are generally not cognizant of the threat of money laundering and have devoted inadequate resources to the problem. Schemes used to launder funds include the under-invoicing of imports, double bookkeeping, and misuse of the banking system.

Armenia currently has no anti-money laundering statutes. However, the new draft Armenian criminal code includes a statute that for the first time would criminalize money laundering. The Government of Armenia expects the new draft criminal code to pass its third and final reading in parliament in early 2001.

Armenia is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

Aruba (Concern). Aruba has a growing offshore industry, casinos, and free zones that make it both attractive and vulnerable to money launderers. However, the Government of Aruba (GOA) is establishing a solid anti-money laundering program. Money laundering is a crime in Aruba, and money-laundering offenses extend to all predicate criminal offenses, including tax offenses.

The GOA has developed a comprehensive anti-money laundering program, and further strengthened its legislation this year. The GOA's new anti-money laundering initiatives include four State Decrees: a State Decree listing suspicious activity indicators for casinos, which will take effect in April 2001; a State Decree on the supervision of captive insurers, and one on the supervision of insurance underwriters, both of which will be introduced in February 2001; and a State Decree, which becomes effective January 1, 2001, that will permit the Central Bank of Aruba to supervise insurance companies. The Central Bank of Aruba is in charge of implementing this Decree, which provides the legal basis for supervision of onshore or offshore insurance companies operating in Aruba.

In March 2001, a State Ordinance is expected to be issued that will extend reporting and identification requirements to casinos.

In October 2000, a State Ordinance was enacted requiring life insurance agents to report unusual transactions, based on indicators. As of January 1, 2000, the Government of Aruba began working on the principles of the law, which will be implemented during the first half of the year 2001.

On July 4, 2000, the Aruban Parliament unanimously approved the State Ordinance Free Zones Aruba, which will implement standards for the sector. Aruba is also working with its counterparts in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) to develop regional standards for free zones, since none currently exist. Once developed, CFATF members have agreed to implement these standards.

In June 2000, Aruba enacted a State Ordinance making it a legal requirement to report both the importation and exportation of currency in excess of 20,000 Aruban guilders (approximately US $11,235). The State decree to implement the law will be introduced in the early part of 2001.

The GOA has prepared a State Ordinance for the Supervision of Trust Companies. The draft ordinance provides for the oversight of thrift companies to ensure that they follow ""Know Your Customer"" procedures. The draft was submitted to an advisory committee. After the committee completes its review and provides comments, the draft will be returned to the government officials responsible for the law and then submitted to parliament for approval. Aruban officials are striving to enact the Ordinance early in 2001.

All financial institutions report unusual transactions to the Meldpunt Ongebruikelijke Transacties (MOT), Aruba's financial intelligence unit. The MOT is a member of the Egmont Group. A draft law, which would authorize the MOT to share information with foreign counterpart organizations with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), is now with the central committee.

Aruba has a small offshore sector compared to more established offshore jurisdictions. Services include finance companies, offshore banks, investment and holding companies and the Aruba Exempt Company (AEC). There are approximately 4700 AECs that are permitted to offer bearer shares. AECs pay an annual registration fee of approximately US $280, and must have a minimum authorized capital of US $6,000. AECs cannot participate in the economy of Aruba, and are exempt from several obligations-they are exempt from all taxes and currency restrictions, and need not file annual financial statements. Trust companies provide a wide range of corporate management and professional services to AECs, including looking after the interests of its shareholders, stockholders, or other creditors. In May 2000, the GOA issued Guidance Notes on sound corporate governance practices.

On August 31, 2000, the United States signed a multilateral agreement, with Aruba, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela, to establish an international task force to fight the money laundering that occurs through the ""Black Market Peso Exchange""(BMPE). The BMPE is believed to be the largest money laundering system in the Western Hemisphere, and the primary money laundering method used by Colombian drug cartels. The task force will develop policy options and recommend enforcement actions to detect, prevent and prosecute money laundering by the BPME. The agreement also provides for enhanced information sharing among the signatories. The first task force meeting was held in Aruba on October 21, 2000 and was chaired by the director of the Aruba Free Zone. The next meeting will take place in March 2001.

Aruba, which has autonomous control over its internal affairs, is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and, as such, is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Aruba has signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the Unite States. Aruban judicial authorities have maintained an excellent record of cooperation under the MLAT.

Aruba's anti-money laundering legislation largely adheres to the recommendations of FATF and the CFATF. Furthermore, Aruba's efforts this year culminated in their first money laundering prosecution for drug trafficking. The Government of Aruba has shown a commitment to combating money laundering. With continued vigilance Aruba's vulnerability to money laundering should decrease.

Australia (Primary). The Government of Australia (GOA) has in place a balanced, comprehensive system to detect, prevent, and prosecute money laundering. In 1995, a comprehensive money laundering study commissioned by the GOA estimated that each year approximately US $2.8 billion is laundered in or through Australia, or offshore. The major sources of criminal proceeds laundered in Australia are narcotics trafficking and financial fraud.

The Government of Australia (GOA) has enacted comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation that criminalizes money laundering related to serious crimes, and mandates various forms of reporting. Moreover, the legislation provides for assistance to other governments with asset seizure and forfeiture. Three pieces of legislation form the basis of Australia's anti-money laundering regime: the Financial Transaction Reports Act (FTR) of 1988; the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) of 1987; and the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) of 1987.

The FTR was enacted in 1988 to combat tax evasion, money laundering and serious crime. The FTR requires that the following entities report suspicious transactions, cash transactions in excess of Australian $10,000, and international funds transfers to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC), Australia's financial intelligence unit: financial institutions; insurance businesses; securities dealers; trustees; sellers of monetary instruments; bullion dealers; gaming establishments and services; persons who collect, hold, or deliver currency on behalf of others; and persons who prepare payrolls for others in whole or in part from collected currency. AUSTRAC was established under section 35 of the FTR, and was given a regulatory role vis-a-vis Australia's financial services sector. The MACMA allows Australian authorities to assist other countries in identifying, freezing, seizing, and confiscating the proceeds of crime. The POCA criminalized money laundering for all serious crimes, and contains provisions to assist investigations and prosecutions in the form of production orders, search warrants, and monitoring orders.

Australia is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), the South Pacific Forum, and the Commonwealth Secretariat. AUSTRAC is a member of the Egmont Group. Australia continues to promote the adoption of effective anti-money laundering measures by countries in the Asia/Pacific region, through its funding and hosting of the Secretariat of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and by raising the issue of money laundering to a priority concern at the Asia/Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. In September 1999, a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between Australia and the United States entered into force. AUSTRAC and FinCEN have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the exchange of information. AUSTRAC also has bilateral agreements allowing the exchange of information with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Belgium, France, Hungary, and Denmark.

Australia is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Australia continues to have a comprehensive and effective anti-money laundering regime that adheres to the FATF Forty Recommendations. Australia's approach to combat money laundering and its demonstrated ability to adapt to change, serve as a model for other countries to emulate. The GOA should continue to support the APG and provide money laundering training and technical assistance for the Asia/Pacific region.

Austria (Primary). Austria is not a major financial center. Money laundering has been a criminal offense in Austria since 1993. A major risk for money laundering in Austria has been the existence of anonymous bank accounts known as Sparbuch (savings book) accounts. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) threatened to suspend Austria's membership if Austria did not terminate these accounts by June 15, 2000.

In June 2000, the Government of Austria (GOA) approved legislation, the Banking Act Amendment, that addressed the FATF's concerns. Beginning November 2, 2000, applicants for new passbook accounts must be identified. In addition, if deposits are made to an existing passbook account, the holder must be identified-except for deposit transfers from anonymous securities accounts opened prior to August 1, 1996. After June 30, 2002, if a withdrawal is made from an existing passbook account-and the holder has not previously been identified-the holder must be identified. A June 15, 2000 press release indicates that the FATF will closely monitor Austria's implementation of these measures. The GOA in 1996 abolished anonymous securities accounts. Although new deposits are not allowed, customers can continue to make withdrawals and sales from these accounts without identification until June 2002.

In June 2000, the Ministry of Finance sent a circular to Austrian banks advising them to use special diligence in splitting passbook account balances-except among family members-exceeding one million Austrian schillings (approximately US $68,500). Austrian banks are required to continue exercising this enhanced diligence until anonymous accounts are completely phased out in June 2002.

The GOA imposes customer identification requirements for bank transactions exceeding Austrian shillings 200,000 (approximately US $13,700) for customers without a permanent business relationship with the bank. Bank records must be maintained for a minimum of five years after the business relationship has terminated. Banks, insurers, and foreign exchange bureaus are required to report suspicious transactions. Austria's financial intelligence unit, the Central Department for Combating Organized Crime, receives and analyzes financial disclosures, and is a member of the Egmont Group.

Austria has not enacted domestic legislation that provides for sharing narcotics-related assets with other governments. However, a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) has been in force since August 1, 1998 between the GOA and the United States, which contains an asset-sharing provision. The GOA has been cooperative with US law enforcement investigations. Austria has a bilateral agreement with Hungary concerning the exchange of information related to money laundering. Austria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Austria is a member of the FATF and the European Union.

The GOA should continue to develop a comprehensive anti-money laundering regime. By enacting legislation to eliminate anonymous passbook accounts, the GOA has taken an important step toward combating money laundering. The GOA should ensure full implementation of this new law. Continued diligence on the part of the GOA will be instrumental in helping to thwart money laundering in Austria.

Azerbaijan (Other). Azerbaijan's banking system is rudimentary; and its banking laws change frequently. Several banks have been closed as part of a government effort to consolidate the banking sector. Available information suggests that non-bank financial institutions probably are used to launder money related to tax evasion and avoidance of customs fees. The transportation of illegal source currency falls within the purview of the Organized Crime Division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of National Security. However, these agencies probably are more concerned with stopping the transportation of funds used for anti-state activities such as anti-government propaganda and terrorism than funds generated from narcotics trafficking. Azerbaijan does not have anti-money laundering legislation.

Azerbaijan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Bahamas (Primary). The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is an important regional financial center; its well-developed offshore financial center, strong bank secrecy laws, weak regulation of international business companies (IBCs), and inadequate customer identification requirements have made it vulnerable to money laundering and other financial crimes. The offshore financial industry includes trust companies, 413 banks, 580 mutual funds, 30 insurance companies, and approximately 100,000 International Business Companies (IBCs).

In June 2000, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) identified The Bahamas as ""non-cooperative in the fight against money laundering."" In its report, FATF stated cited the following concerns:

Although The Bahamas has comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation, there are serious deficiencies in its system. In particular, there is a lack of information about the beneficial ownership as to trusts and IBCs, which are allowed to issue bearer shares. There is also a serious breach in identification rules since certain intermediaries can invoke their professional code of conduct to avoid revealing the identity of their clients. International cooperation has been marked by long delays and restricted responses to requests for assistance and there is no room to cooperate outside of judicial channels.

In July 2000, the US Treasury Department issued an advisory to US financial institutions warning them to give enhanced scrutiny to financial transactions involving The Bahamas, particularly those transactions that do not involve established and adequately identified commercial or investment enterprises.

Under legislation in force prior to December 2000, The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas (GOCB) supervisory officials had to seek a court order to obtain access to customer information held by Bahamian banks and trust companies. Moreover, the failure of Bahamian banks to obtain identifying information about customers limited their effectiveness in recognizing and avoiding money-laundering transactions. Banks were not required to verify the identity of customers whose accounts were opened by Bahamian lawyers and certain other intermediaries. It is unclear whether these entities' legal obligation to report suspicious transactions was preempted by their professional secrecy obligations.

The GCOB has taken significant steps to address the shortcomings in its anti-money laundering regime. In May 2000, the GCOB enacted legislation requiring that individuals declare currency in excess of US $10,000 when entering or leaving the country. Moreover, in December 2000, the GCOB enacted the following legislation and regulations: Proceeds of Crime Act No. 44 of 2000, Dangerous Drugs Act 2000, Criminal Justice (International Co-Operation) Act 2000, Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2000, the Central Bank of the Bahamas Act 2000, Banks and Trust Companies Regulation Act 2000, Financial and Corporate Service Providers Act 2000, International Business Companies (IBC) Act 2000, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) Act 2000, Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Regulations Act of 2000, and Financial Transactions Reporting Regulations of 2000.

The Proceeds of Crime Act 2000, which supersedes the amended Money Laundering (Proceeds of Crime) Act, also expands the number of predicate crimes for money laundering to include drug trafficking, bribery, public corruption, and other serious crimes; expands the definition of the money laundering offence by introducing the concept of ""reasonable suspicion,"" rather than requiring actual knowledge of the nature of the proceeds; and provides immunity from civil liability for disclosure of information to the Supervisory Authority or the Attorney General. In addition, for the first time, the new Proceeds of Crime Act 2000 provides for seizure, detention and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime, including money laundering; establishes penalties for failure to disclose knowledge or suspicion of money laundering; and, authorizes enforcement of domestic and external confiscation orders.

The International Business Companies Act (IBC), 2000, ends anonymous ownership of IBCs. The new legislation requires IBCs to have a registered office and agent in The Bahamas, to hold general meetings at least annually, to maintain a register of officers and directors that is available to the public, and to maintain a share register containing the names and addresses of the beneficial owners of shares, along with other information that is accessible by supervisory authorities. The Act also eliminates bearer shares and requires current owners of bearer shares to convert them to regular shares within a specified time frame. IBCs that fail to comply with these provisions will be struck from the register of companies.

The Financial and Corporate Service Providers Act 2000 regulates lawyers, accountants, and business managers engaged in the registration or management of IBCs.

The Financial Intelligence Unit Act 2000 establishes the GCOB's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The Act gives the FIU authority to compel production-without a court order-of information and documents, and to exchange information with foreign FIUs. The Act also permits the lifting of financial secrecy provisions for inquiries concerning money laundering. Moreover, the FIU-in consultation with financial regulators-will issue specific guidelines to financial institutions for the mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions. The Act also establishes ""safe harbor"" protection from criminal, civil, and professional sanctions for individuals who provide information to the FIU. The GCOB has consulted with the Caribbean Anti-Money Laundering Programme for guidance in the establishment of an FIU. More recently, the GCOB requested that the United Nations Global Program Against Money Laundering provide it with a list of candidates from which to select a long-term mentor to assist with the development of its FIU. As currently envisioned, the FIU will have a staff of ten. Managerial positions have been filled, and the FIU is expected to become fully operational in 2001.

The Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2000 establishes ""know your customer"" requirements for banks, trust companies, securities broker-dealers, casinos, real estate brokers, insurance companies, co-operative societies, counsel/attorneys/accountants relative to certain transactions and others. These entities will be required to verify the identities of existing customers within 12 months, and report suspicious transactions to the FIU. The Act also creates a Compliance Commission to ensure the financial sector's compliance with the Act by institutions other than banks and trust companies. In accordance with the Act, in December 2000, the Ministry of Finance issued the Financial Transactions Reporting Regulations 2000. These regulations require institutions to verify the identity of persons conducting transactions of $10,000 or more.

The Banks and Trust Companies Regulation Act 2000 provides for cross-border supervision by banking regulators of foreign banks and trust companies with branches or subsidiaries operating in The Bahamas consistent with the principles established by the Basle Committee. The Central Bank of Bahamas Act 2000 expands the powers of the central bank to respond to requests for information from foreign regulatory authorities. The Act also grants the central bank governor the authority to deny licenses to banks or trusts that are deemed unfit to conduct business in The Bahamas.

The Bahamas is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and is a member of the CFATF and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors. The Attorney General has established an International Affairs Unit to deal specifically with mutual legal assistance matters. The Bahamas has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States, which entered into force in 1990.

The GCOB continues to further its anti-money laundering efforts with enactment of new laws, establishment of an FIU, and its stated intention to join the Egmont Group. The GCOB has enacted substantial reforms that could reduce its financial sector's vulnerability to money laundering. The GCOB now needs to focus on fully implementing its new legislation.

Bahrain (Concern). Bahrain is vulnerable to money laundering because it is a regional financial and offshore center. The most common sources of illegal proceeds in Bahrain include narcotics trafficking, fraud, and evasion of international sanctions. Bahrain recently passed legislation that reportedly criminalizes money laundering.

Bahrain has 19 commercial banking institutions-seven locally incorporated and 12 subsidiaries of foreign banks-and has 48 offshore banking units (OBUs). The Bahrain Monetary Authority (BMA) licenses OBUs. The BMA requires that OBUs be audited yearly by outside firms that have been approved by the BMA. OBUs cannot do business with residents of Bahrain-except for agencies of the GOB-and must conduct all transactions in foreign currency. However, OBUs may participate in domestic development projects with the approval of the BMA. OBUs also must be fully staffed, and a majority of the staff must be Bahraini nationals. The books and records of OBUs must be available for examination by the BMA at all times. OBUs are required to submit statistical reports to the BMA twice yearly. OBUs are exempt from taxes and are not subject to restrictions regarding foreign exchange payments or receipts.

Bahrain also permits formation of two forms of international business companies (IBCs): offshore resident companies and offshore non-resident companies. Offshore resident companies must have a principal office in Bahrain and a minimum capitalization of US $54,000. The company must obtain a license from the BMA if it conducts financial activities. Offshore non-resident companies are exempt from the requirement of maintaining an office in Bahrain, and may instead appoint a law or auditing firm in Bahrain as their resident address. Non-resident companies must have a minimum capitalization of US $6,750, but cannot engage in insurance or other financial activities. Registration of an IBC can take as little as seven days, and there are no restrictions on remittances sent abroad.

In January 2001, new legislation went into effect by Amiri decree that reportedly criminalizes money laundering for a number of predicate offenses, requires the reporting of large transactions, provides specific guidelines for accepting transactions, and increases monitoring of banking activity.

Legislation in force prior to the enactment Bahrain's new anti-money laundering legislation obligates financial institutions to report suspicious transactions greater than Bahraini dinars (BD) 10,000 (approximately US $26,000) to the BMA. However, the BMA has not provided guidance to Bahraini banks on how to identify suspicious transactions.

Bahrain is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which represents it before the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In June 2000, Bahrain underwent a FATF mutual evaluation. Bahrain is a member of the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors and has agreed to undergo a mutual evaluation by this body. Bahrain is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

Bahrain should ensure that its offshore sector is subject to adequate supervision.

Bangladesh (Other). Bangladesh is not an important financial center. Money laundering in Bangladesh is primarily related to income tax evasion and the illegal importation of consumer goods. There is no evidence that the proceeds of drug trafficking are laundered in Bangladesh. However, Bangladesh has not criminalized money laundering and banking regulation is weak and sporadic. Corruption among officials is believed to be high.

Bangladesh is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and is a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering.

Barbados (Concern). The Government of Barbados (GOB) has taken several steps in recent years to strengthen its anti-money laundering regime.

The Money Laundering (Prevention and Control) Act (MLPCA) 1998 criminalizes transactions that involve the proceeds of unlawful activities that are punishable by at least one-year imprisonment. The legislation also authorized creation of the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) to supervise financial institutions' compliance with the Act. However, the AMLA was not established until 1 August 2000, and its financial intelligence unit (FIU) was not established until 1 September 2000. The FIU is now fully staffed and operating. The AMLA also may issue training requirements and regulations for financial institutions. Money laundering is punishable in Barbados by a maximum of 25 years in prison and a maximum fine of Barbadian (BB) $2 million, (approximately US $1 million). The law also contains asset seizure and forfeiture provisions.

The MLPCA applies to a wide range of institutions, including domestic and offshore banks, international business companies (IBCs), and insurance companies. These institutions are required to identify their customers, to cooperate with domestic law enforcement investigations, to maintain records of all transactions exceeding BB $10,000, and to report suspicious transactions to the AMLA. The AMLA forwards this information to the Commissioner of Police if it has reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering.

The GOB initially criminalized money laundering in 1990 through the Proceeds of Crime Act, No. 13. This law also authorizes asset confiscation and forfeiture and provides a disclosure protection safe harbor for individuals reporting suspicious activities. In 1997, the central bank issued Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines for Licensed Financial Institutions.

Barbados is an offshore center and offers offshore banking, international trusts, exempt insurance companies, IBCs, and foreign sales corporations (FSCs)-specialized companies that permit persons to engage in foreign trade transactions from within Barbados. Unofficial sources report Barbados has approximately 51 offshore banks, 376 exempt insurance companies, 3,855 IBCs and 2,975 foreign sales corporations.

The Offshore Banking Act (1980) gives the central bank authority to supervise and regulate offshore banks, in addition to Barbados's nine domestic commercial banks. Barbadian, Canadian-parent, and United Kingdom-parent banks operate on equal terms in Barbados. The Ministry of Finance issues licenses after the central bank receives and reviews applications, and recommends applicants for licensing. Offshore banks must submit quarterly statements of assets and liabilities and annual balance sheets to the central bank. Profits from offshore banks are subject to a 2.5 percent tax rate for profits of BB $10 million or less, and not less than 1 percent for profits exceeding BB $10 million.

The International Business Companies Act (1992) provides for general administration of IBCs. The Ministry of International Trade and Business vets and grants licenses to IBCs after applicants register with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs. Barbadian IBC's must pay a 2.5 percent tax on profits up to BB $20 million, with decreasing tax rates on additional profits. Bearer shares are not allowed, and financial statements of IBCs are audited if total assets exceed BB $1 million. Barbados has bilateral tax treaties that eliminate or reduce double taxation with the UK, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Canada's treaty allows IBC and offshore banking profits to be repatriated to Canada tax-free after paying the 2.5 percent tax in Barbados.

In 1996, the United States and Barbados signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty and an extradition treaty. Both treaties were brought into force in 2000 by an exchange of instruments of ratification. Barbados is a member of the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors, the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering. Barbados is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

The GOB needs to maintain strict control over vetting and licensing of offshore entities. The establishment of the AMLA should provide Barbados the necessary resources to enforce compliance by financial and commercial sectors, and enable it to fully cooperate with foreign authorities to investigate and prosecute money laundering and other financial crimes.

Belarus (Other). Money laundering does not seem to be a major problem in Belarus. However, Belarus has no anti-money laundering laws, and does not have in place significant laws, regulations, or other procedures to detect it. Banks are more inclined to focus on protecting the secrecy of their clients than on discovering and reporting irregular or unaccounted-for deposits. The growing number of casinos also could become venues for money laundering.

Belarus faces problems with organized crime that plague other countries of the former Soviet Union. The lack of anti-money laundering laws could lead organized crime to engage in more substantial money laundering in Belarus.

Belgium (Concern). Belgium's financial system is vulnerable to money laundering; approximately 60 percent of the suspicious transactions reports filed by Belgian financial institutions are related to drug trafficking. Illicit funds are laundered in Belgium through the diamond industry, real estate, front companies, gambling or amusement halls, currency exchange bureaus, international wire transfers, and banks. Belgium has a comprehensive anti-money laundering regime.

The Government of Belgium (GOB) in 1990 criminalized money laundering related to all crimes, and in 1993, passed additional legislation that mandated reporting of suspicious transactions by financial institutions and created a financial intelligence unit (FIU), Financial Information Processing Center (CTIF-CFI), to analyze them. As of June 2000, the CTIF-CFI had created 8,094 distinct case files since becoming operational in 1993, and 2,020 between July 1999 and June 2000. The CTIF-CFI is member of the Egmont Group.

Belgian financial institutions are required to maintain records on the identities of clients engaged in transactions that are considered suspicious, or that involve an amount equal to or greater than EUR 10,000 (approximately US $9,400). Financial institutions also are required to train their personnel in the detection and handling of suspicious transactions that could be linked to money laundering. No civil, penal, or disciplinary actions can be taken against institutions or individuals for reporting such transactions in good faith.

In 1998 and 1999, the GOB adopted legislation that mandates the reporting of suspicious transactions by notaries, accountants, bailiffs, real estate agents, casinos, cash transporters, external tax consultants, certified accountants, and certified accountant-tax experts. Casinos also are required to report certain other transactions.

The Judicial Police have primary responsibility for investigating money laundering in Belgium. However, the Gendarmerie also can investigate money laundering if the predicate offense is one over which the Gendarmerie has jurisdiction.

Belgium is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Union. Belgium is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Belgium has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States, which entered into force on January 1, 2000. The GOB exchanges information with other countries through international treaties and with foreign FIUs that have secrecy obligations similar to those of CTIF/CFI.

Belize (Concern). Belize is vulnerable to money laundering because of its growing offshore sector, which has two banks, an unknown number of international trusts, and over 16,000 international business companies (IBCs). Belize also has one Internet gaming site.

In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducted a review of Belize's anti-money laundering regime against 25 specified criteria. Belize was not identified by the FATF as a noncooperative country in the international fight against money laundering. However, the FATF in its June report noted the following about Belize's anti-money laundering regime:

Since criminalizing money laundering in 1996, Belize has generally pursued policies in law and regulation aimed at fostering a sound anti-money laundering regime. Belize has, nonetheless, certain deficiencies with regard to IBCs, particularly in the identification of beneficial owners and in ascertaining other information that could prove useful in protecting against criminal abuse of its offshore sector.

The International Business Companies Act of 1990 (Amended 1995) established a licensing system and a regulatory body, the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC), for Belize's offshore sector. The IFSC is comprised primarily of individuals with ties to the offshore industry. IBCs can no longer issue bearer shares, and the Government of Belize (GOB) reportedly is considering ways to abolish or immobilize bearer shares that are already in existence. IBC records are maintained by the Belize International Services Limited, a subsidiary of CHI Corporation, a company traded on the NASDAQ and formerly known as BHI Corporation. Offshore trusts are prevalent in Belize because they do not have to be registered with any regulatory body.

Belize's Offshore Banking Act (OBA), which regulates offshore banks, and the Money Laundering Prevention Act (MLPA) have been in force since 1996. The MLPA criminalizes money laundering related to many serious crimes; mandates reporting of suspicious transactions by banks and non-bank financial institutions; specifies penalties for banks, non-bank financial institutions, and intermediaries who assist and collaborate in money laundering; and authorizes international cooperation in money laundering cases. The OBA and the Financial Institutions Act require financial institutions to report the identities of customers who engage in currency transactions of a large, complex, or unusual nature.

The Ministry of Finance has the authority to examine financial institutions' records. Financial institutions are required to retain records for a minimum of five years, and can lose their licenses and face a maximum fine of US $50,000 for failing to do so. Individual bankers can be held responsible if their institutions are caught laundering money. However, bankers can be protected from prosecution if they cooperate with law enforcement.

In 2000, the GOB reportedly issued the International Financial Services Commission (Licensing) Regulations 2000, which specifies licensing requirements for Belize's offshore financial services providers. Under the regulations, only lawyers, accountants, and companies registered under the Company Act as financial institutions would be eligible for such a license. The GOB has proposed draft legislation, the Customs Regulation Act, which would require individuals to declare cross-border movements of currency that exceed US $5,000.

The GOB has not prosecuted a single money laundering case under the MLPA, and in 2000, made no money laundering arrests. The GOB has an investigative unit within the National Criminal Investigation Branch that works with the central bank on financial cases.

Belize is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Belize is a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), and the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering. In August 2000, the GOB made a ministerial-level commitment to adhere to the minimum performance standards agreed to at the March 2000 UN Global Program Against Money Laundering. The United States and Belize have signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), but it is not yet in force.

The GOB should pass legislation that requires offshore trusts to be registered with a central authority. Moreover, the GOB should take appropriate steps to ensure that its oversight of IBCs is conducted free of undue influence from the industry.

Benin (Other). Benin is not a major financial center. However, Beninese officials believe their country is being used by narcotics traffickers to launder profits. Although the exact nature of money laundering is unknown, Beninese officials suspect that the primary method is through the purchase of assets such as real estate, the wholesale shipment of vehicles or items for resale, and front companies. In addition, some laundering seems to occur through the banking system.

A 1997 anti-narcotics law criminalizes narcotics-related money laundering, and provides penalties of up to 20 years in prison as well as substantial fines. The law requires that all financial institutions report transactions they believe may be narcotics-related; they enjoy safe harbor protection if they do so. Financial institutions that fail to comply are subject to prison terms for their officials and fines. However, the government has not taken any significant steps to address the problem of money laundering not related to narcotics trafficking.

Benin is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Bermuda (Other). Bermuda has a large offshore financial services sector that may be attractive to money laundering. However, the Government of Bermuda has taken a number of measures to aid in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of financial crimes. As with the other British Caribbean Overseas Territories, Bermuda underwent a thorough evaluation of its financial regulation in 2000, co-sponsored by the local and British governments.

Bermuda's offshore financial sector is dominated by its nearly 1,300 insurance (mainly captive and reinsurance) companies. The sector also has approximately 11,000 ""exempt companies"" (international business companies). The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) is the main regulator and requires disclosure and vetting of proposed beneficial owners before registering exempt companies.

The Proceeds of Crime Act 1997 criminalizes money laundering related to all ""relevant offenses,"" including drug trafficking, corruption, counterfeiting, and fraud. The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Regulations 1998 contain a number of obligations for regulated institutions, including customer identification, record keeping, and reporting of suspicious transactions. The government also issued guidance notes in 1998 to assist financial institutions to recognize suspicious transactions and comply with their obligations.

The Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), within the Bermuda Police Service, serves as Bermuda's financial intelligence unit. It receives, analyzes, and investigates suspicious activity report (SARs). Through the end of 1999, the unit had received approximately 2,400 SARs. The FIU is a member of the Egmont Group.

Bermuda is subject to the US/UK MLAT and the US/UK extradition treaty. Bermuda is a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), and through the UK, is also a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Bermuda is also a member of the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors (OGBS).

Continued supervision and enforcement of regulations in the financial sector are necessary to discourage infiltration by organized crime and money launderers. Bermuda should also consider devoting additional resources toward investigative efforts to combat money laundering to more thoroughly deter international criminals.

Bolivia (Concern). Bolivia is not major financial center, and does not have an offshore sector. However, Bolivia has had a long tradition of banking secrecy that has facilitated money laundering, particularly the profits of contraband smuggling, organized crime, and drug trafficking.

The Government of Bolivia (GOB) criminalized money laundering related to organized criminal activities and public corruption through the 1988 Controlled Substances Law (No. 1008) and Law 1768 of March 1997, which amended Bolivia's Penal Code. Law 1768 also authorized creation of the Financial Investigations Unit (FIU) within the Office of the Superintendent of Banks and Financial Institutions to be responsible for implementing anti-money laundering controls. Decree 24771 of July 1997 requires banks, brokerages, and insurance companies to identify their customers, retain records of transactions for a minimum of 10 years, and report unusual and suspicious financial transactions to the FIU. The FIU has established mechanisms for sharing information with Bolivia's Public Ministry and the Special Counter-Narcotics Force (FELCN). However, personnel shortages within the Public Ministry, law enforcement, and the FIU, as well as the FIU's inability to monitor the activities of certain financial institutions, have hindered full implementation and enforcement of Bolivia's anti-money laundering controls.

The FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. Bolivia is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Bolivia is a member of the Organization of American States Inter-American Commission on Drug Abuse Control (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering, and is a member of the South America Financial Action Task Force (GAFISUD). The GOB and the United States in 1995 signed an extradition treaty, which entered into force in 1996.

The GOB is urged to extend provisions of its anti-money laundering legislation to cover all financial institutions and to ensure that anti-money laundering bodies are sufficiently staffed.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (Other). Bosnia and Herzegovina is neither a financial center nor a money-laundering center. Laundering the proceeds of criminal activity through financial institutions is widespread, although narcotics proceeds tend to be diverted outside Bosnia. Neither US currency nor proceeds of drug sales in the US are significantly involved. Bosnia is a significant consumer of and transit point for a variety of illegal goods traded on the black market and has experienced an alarming increase in alien smuggling, which is conservatively estimated to amount to US $50 million per year. Money laundering has not been criminalized, but is now prohibited in the civil code.

Regulatory supervision of the banking sector is largely vested at the local rather than the federal level through two separate but roughly parallel banking agencies. Although legislation generally reflects the Basle Committee's core principles, including suspicious transaction reporting and due diligence requirements, in practice banking standards do not conform to international norms, as recent bank failures have demonstrated. Some safe harbor protection has now been afforded to banking officials for actions taken in the course of their professional duties. However, Bosnia's laws remain an unwieldy combination of communist-era statutes and internationally imposed reforms. Enforcement is tenuous at best in this cash-based, largely unregulated economy, thereby creating widespread potential for financial crime.

In addition, ambiguous lines of responsibility among investigative and regulatory agencies have aggravated already rampant political interference in investigations and direct intimidation of officials.

Bosnia is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and in December 2000 it signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Botswana (Other). Botswana is neither a major financial center nor a money-laundering center; it is, however, an offshore financial center. The Government of Botswana has enacted strict legislation against drug production and trafficking, as well as narcotics-related money laundering. The Bank of Botswana has the discretion to provide information on large currency transactions to law enforcement agencies.

Because of concerns that Botswana's status as an offshore financial center could increase its vulnerability to money laundering, regulations reportedly have been drafted that would regulate Botswana's International Financial Services Center (IFSC).

Botswanan officials have expressed interest in obtaining training to combat bank fraud and money laundering.

Botswana is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and is expected to sign the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group's Memorandum of Understanding in 2001.

Brazil (Primary). Money laundering that is related to drug trafficking and white-collar crime continues to occur in Brazil despite the Government of Brazil's (GOB) efforts to introduce regulatory and investigative measures to address the problem. A highly developed financial sector and an increasing problem with local drug consumption and trafficking have made Brazil a money-laundering center. In December 2000, a Brazilian Congressional Investigative Committee (CPI) probing narcotics trafficking released a 1,200-page report that detailed a vast network of drug-related organized crime, corruption, and money laundering. The report implicated over 800 people, including two federal congressmen, former state governors and other officials. The CPI estimates that approximately $50 billion is laundered in Brazil annually.

The GOB has a comprehensive anti-money laundering regulatory regime in place. Law 9613 of March 3, 1998 criminalized money laundering related to drug trafficking and other offenses, and penalizes offenders with a maximum of 16 years in prison. The law expanded the GOB's asset seizure and forfeiture provisions and exempts ""good faith"" compliance from criminal or civil prosecution.

The law also created the GOB's financial intelligence unit (FIU), the Council for the Control of Financial Activities (COAF), which is housed within the Ministry of Finance. The COAF includes representatives from regulatory and law enforcement agencies-including the central bank and Federal Police-and has a staff of 16 people with plans to expand to 22 in 2001. The COAF regulates those financial sectors not already under the jurisdiction of another supervising entity. In 1999, the COAF issued regulations that addressed real estate, factoring companies, gaming and lotteries, dealers in jewelry and precious metals, bingo, credit cards, commodities trading, and dealers in art and antiques. The regulations require customer identification, record keeping, and reporting of suspicious transactions directly to the COAF. In 2000 the COAF issued regulations slightly amending the bingo, lotteries, and gaming regulations.

As of October 2000, the COAF indicated that it had received, since its inception, 5,208 suspicious transactions reports (STRs), involving approximately 5 million reais (approximately US $2.5 million). Nearly 1000 of these reports were generated from bingo, leading the COAF to speculate that this sector may be experiencing the largest expansion in money-laundering activity. By the end of 2000, the COAF reported that it had received 6,673 STRs, leading to over 130 ongoing investigations and 100 prosecutions.

In 1999, the GOB's other regulatory bodies, the central bank, the Securities Commission (CVM), the Examiner of Private Insurance Companies (SUSEP), and the Office of Supplemental Pension Plans (PC), issued parallel regulations to covered institutions that spell out requirements for customer identification and reporting of suspicious transactions. All of these regulations include a list of guidelines that help institutions identify suspicious transactions. The central bank also established the DECIF (Departamento de Combate a Il�citos Cambiais e Financeiros) to implement anti-money laundering policy, receive suspicious activity reports from financial institutions, and forward information to the COAF. Current bank secrecy provisions, however, protect specific account information, and thus the COAF receives only partial information from the central bank. All other government agencies-except for congressional investigative committees-must get a court order to access detailed bank account and subject information. International requestors may only obtain this information through a letter rogatory. In early January 2001, however, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed into law a measure that will give all regulatory bodies direct access to complete banking information without court approval. However, some Brazilian legal scholars and legislators predict that the legislation will face judicial review that is likely to render it unconstitutional.

Regulations issued in 1998 require that individuals transporting more than 10,000 reais (approximately US $5,000) in cash, checks or traveler's checks across the Brazilian border must fill out a customs declaration that is sent to the central bank. Financial institutions remitting more than 10,000 reais (approximately US $5,000) also must make a declaration to the central bank.

In August 2000, Brazil hosted a summit of South American presidents; the agenda of which included signing a memorandum of understanding creating the South American Financial Action Task Force (GAFISUD). In December 2000, Brazil and the other member countries of MERCOSUR signed an agreement outlining cooperation among central banks in money laundering investigations.

The GOB continues to investigate and prosecute large money laundering operations. A joint investigation by the Federal Police, the central bank, the Federal Revenue Office, and the COAF uncovered a network that allegedly laundered 30 billion reais (approximately US $15 billion) between 1998 and 1999. Most of the laundered funds were the proceeds of drug trafficking, and trafficking in weapons and goods. Illicit funds from several Brazilian states were sent primarily to Foz de Igua�u, a city near the border with Paraguay, where the launderers used exchange houses, more than 100 large companies, 300 ""laranjas,"" (individuals who allow their names to be used for a fee), and special non-resident ""CC-5"" accounts to transfer the money abroad. The Federal Police-who are cooperating with international authorities to track down the funds-have made several arrests and secured over 300 indictments in the case.

The Brazilian press has reported extensively on the investigation of Judge Nicolau dos Santos Neto, who is accused of embezzling 169 million reais (approximately $85 million) in funds earmarked for construction of a city courthouse. Nicolau allegedly used a system of front companies in offshore havens to transfer money and buy property abroad, including the United States. Brazilian authorities have been working with foreign authorities to track down these assets, and thus far, have identified bank accounts in the United States and Switzerland-the latter totaling approximately $4 million-and an apartment in Miami worth approximately $1 million. In December, Judge Nicolau turned himself in to authorities and now awaits trial on charges of embezzlement, corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering.

The COAF has been a member of the Egmont Group since May 1999. In June 2000, Brazil became a full member of FATF. The GOB and the United States signed a bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in October 1997. The Brazilian Congress approved this treaty in December 2000, and the treaty will enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification. Brazil is a member of the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering. Brazil is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The GOB has bilateral information exchange agreements with Belgium, France, Paraguay, Portugal, Paraguay, and Spain.

Although the laundering of proceeds from drug trafficking and other crimes remains a major problem in Brazil, the GOB has taken important regulatory and investigative steps to address the problem. However, the GOB should ensure that all regulatory bodies have appropriate access to financial disclosure information. This would facilitate analysis, coordination, and cooperation among domestic and international authorities in their efforts to investigate and prosecute money laundering and other financial crimes.

British Virgin Islands (Concern). The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a Caribbean Overseas Territory (COT) of the United Kingdom (UK). The BVI is vulnerable to money laundering because of an offshore sector that is one of the largest in the Caribbean. Financial services and tourism account for approximately 50 percent of the BVI's economy. The BVI's offshore sector offers incorporation and management of offshore companies, and provision of offshore financial and corporate services. The BVI has 13 banks (four of which are commercial), and approximately 1800 mutual funds, 140 captive insurance companies, 900 registered vessels, 90 licensed trust companies, and 360,000 international business companies (IBCs). Approximately 40 percent of the IBCs are resident in Hong Kong.

According to the International Business Companies Act of 1984, BVI-registered IBCs cannot engage in business with BVI residents, provide registered offices or agent facilities for BVI-incorporated companies, or own an interest in real property located in BVI, except for office leases. BVI's 90 registered agents are licensed by the Financial Services Unit (FSU), and are required to complete certification programs. Registered agents must verify the identities of their clients. The process for registering banks, trust companies, and insurers is governed by legislation that requires more detailed documentation such as a business plan and approval of the appropriate supervisor within the Financial Services Inspectorate.

The BVI criminalized drug money laundering through the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, 1987, amended 1990, and the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act, 1993. The Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, 1997 expanded predicate offenses for money laundering to all criminal conduct, and created a financial intelligence unit, the Reporting Authority-BVI (RA-BVI), which is a member of the Egmont Group. The Financial Investigations Unit (FIU) is responsible for investigating fraud and money laundering cases, and is comprised of three police officers. Most of its investigations have involved IBCs and other offshore entities.

The Anti-Money Laundering Code of Practice (AMLCP), 1999 establishes procedures to identify and report suspicious transactions. The AMLCP requires covered entities to create a clearly defined reporting chain for employees to follow when reporting suspicious transactions, and to appoint a reporting officer to receive these reports. The reporting officer must conduct an initial inquiry into the suspicious transaction and report it to the authorities if sufficient suspicion remains. Failure to report could result in criminal liability. The FIU reportedly reviews approximately 30 suspicious transaction report (STRs) annually. In 1999, the FIU conducted 278 company inquiries, and in 2000, conducted approximately 1200. None of these queries has resulted in prosecutions. To date, the BVI has prosecuted only one money laundering case.

The Joint Anti-Money Laundering Coordinating Committee (JAMLCC) was established in 1999 to coordinate all the BVI's anti-money laundering initiatives. It is a broad-based, multi-disciplinary body comprised of private and public sector representatives. The JAMLCC has drafted Guidance Notes based on those of the UK and Guernsey.

In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reviewed BVI's anti-money laundering regime against 25 criteria. The FATF did not identify the BVI as a noncooperative jurisdiction in the international fight against money laundering. However, the FATF raised certain issues in its June 2000 report:

The BVI allows certain intermediaries, and individuals, which are subject to the same anti-money laundering standards and supervision as financial institutions, to introduce business to banks and financial institutions on the basis that the introducers themselves verify the identify of the customer. In addition, the BVI allows certain institutions based in certain overseas countries, subject to equivalent anti-money laundering systems, to introduce business, without separately verifying the identity of the customer. The banks and the financial institutions are only required to know the name of the client but not to verify the identity separately. There is concern as to whether such a system is consistent with FATF Recommendations and provides sufficiently rigorous checks on the identity of clients of banks and financial institutions, especially in cases where the introducer is not a financial institution.

The BVI also has a large number of IBCs, the formation of which by intermediaries is subject to fewer identification requirements than applied to the company sector as a whole.

In 2000, the BVI passed the Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) (Amendment) Act, 2000, criminalizing the act of acquiring, using, or possessing drug proceeds, and ""tipping off"" individuals under investigation. The BVI also has proposed the Code of Conduct (Service Providers) Act (CCSPA) and the Information Assistance (Financial Services) Act (IAFSA). The CCSPA would encourage professionalism, enhance measures to deter criminal activity, promote ethical conduct, and encourage greater self-regulation in the financial sector. The CCSPA also would establish the Council of Service Providers, a body that would regulate the conduct of individuals within the financial services industry. The Council also would formulate policy, procedures, and other measures to regulate the industry, advise the government on legislation and policy matters, and monitor compliance within the industry. The IAFSA would increase the scope of cooperation between BVI's regulators and regulators from other countries.

The BVI is a member of Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) and, through the UK, is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. The BVI is subject to the US/UK Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.

The BVI should fully implement and enforce all provisions of its recently passed legislation. The BVI also is urged to eliminate any legal and regulatory impediments to international cooperation and exchange of information.

Brunei (Other). Brunei is not known to be a money-laundering center. It is however, an offshore financial center. The Government of Brunei has drafted anti-money laundering legislation and has evinced a strong interest in learning about methods to combat money laundering. Although Brunei has asset forfeiture laws they have not yet been applied to narcotics-related cases. Brunei's Narcotics Control Board has taken part in courses offered by ILEA in Bangkok, and recently attended a money-laundering seminar hosted by DEA in Singapore.

Earlier this year, the Sultanate of Brunei brought into effect a series of laws that established the International Financial Center: the International Business Companies Order 2000; the International Banking Order 2000; the Registered Agents and Trustees Licensing Order 2000; the International Trusts Order 2000; and the International Limited Partnerships Order.

This new offshore financial services center will offer banking services, provide for the formation of IBCs, trusts and limited partnerships. Supervisory authority is reportedly vested in a separate unit of the Ministry of Finance-referred to simply as the ""Authority."" Reports indicate that this entity, however, will combine both regulatory and marketing responsibilities.

Brunei is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Brunei is an observer jurisdiction to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering.

Bulgaria (Concern). Bulgaria, particularly its financial system, is vulnerable to money laundering related to narcotics trafficking and financial crimes such as bank and corporate fraud, embezzlement, tax evasion, tax fraud, and the illegal conversion of state-owned property. The proceeds of drug trafficking, contraband smuggling, vehicle theft, alien smuggling, prostitution, and extortion also are laundered in Bulgaria. The source and destination for much of the illicit funds include Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Turkey, and the Middle East. The presence of organized criminal groups and official corruption contribute to Bulgaria's money laundering problem. Small-scale change bureaus also may play a role. The Government of Bulgaria (GOB) has declared the eradication of organized crime, corruption, and money laundering a national priority.

Bulgaria's anti-money laundering legislation, the Law on Measures Against Money Laundering, entered into force in July 1998. Money laundering is criminalized by Articles 253 and 253a of the Bulgarian Criminal Code; the law applies to the proceeds of all serious crimes. Anti-money laundering measures include customer identification and record keeping requirements, suspicious transaction reporting, and internal rules for financial institutions on implementation of an anti-money laundering program. Banks, securities brokers, auditors, accountants, insurance companies, investment companies, and other businesses are subject to these reporting requirements. Bank information can be obtained by law enforcement through a court order and an instruction from the prosecutor general. The money laundering legislation does not apply to casinos, which are an increasingly important mechanism for laundering money in Bulgaria.

The Ministry of Finance's Bureau of Financial Intelligence (BFI) is Bulgaria's financial intelligence unit. Since its establishment, the BFI has suspended 21 suspicious funds transfers to foreign banks, and has opened seven money-laundering investigations.

The GOB is considering legislation that would address forfeiture and seizure of criminal assets, allow indictment of legal persons on money laundering charges, and prohibit funds of dubious or criminal origin from being used in the acquisition of banks and businesses through the privatization process.

Bulgaria is a member of the Council of Europe (COE) and participates in the COE's Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (PC-R-EV). In November 1999, Bulgaria underwent a mutual evaluation by the PC-R-EV, and has been implementing changes to its anti-money laundering regime based on recommendations in the group's report. Bulgaria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Bulgaria has no bilateral agreements on money laundering.

The GOB is urged to further strengthen its anti-money laundering regime through approval and full implementation of proposed measures that would address seizure and forfeiture of criminal assets; allow indictment of legal persons on money laundering charges; and prohibit funds of dubious or criminal origin from being used in the acquisition of banks and businesses through the privatization process.

Burma (Primary). Burma's economy continues to be vulnerable to drug money laundering because of its under-regulated financial system, weak anti-money laundering regime, and policies that facilitate the funneling of drug money into commercial enterprises and infrastructure investment.

Political and economic constraints on the flow of legitimate capital into Burma have increased the importance of narcotics-derived funds to the Burmese economy. As a result of cease-fire agreements, the Government of Burma (GOB) has encouraged former insurgent groups to invest money into legitimate commercial ventures. This policy has the effect of facilitating the laundering of illegal drug proceeds by some of the former insurgent groups through investments in banks, hotels, and construction companies. Businesses owned by family members of former or present drug traffickers also have invested heavily in infrastructure projects such as roads and port facilities, banks, hotels, casinos, and other real estate development projects.

In 1993, the GOB adopted the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law. This law criminalizes narcotics-related money laundering and allows for seizure of assets that are derived from the drug trade. The GOB has been slow to implement provisions of this law, and has targeted few, if any, traffickers or their assets. GOB officials admit to having difficulty in implementing provisions related to money laundering because of their lack of expertise in money laundering and financial crimes investigations. The GOB reportedly is drafting new anti-money laundering legislation that would address deficiencies in its present legislation.

Burma does not have a financial intelligence unit, and is not active in international or regional anti-money laundering fora. Burma is an observer jurisdiction to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Burma is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. The GOB has bilateral drug control agreements with India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Russia, Laos, and the Philippines. It is not known whether these agreements cover cooperation on money laundering issues.

Burma must increase the regulation and oversight of its banking system, and end policies that facilitate the investment of drug money into the legitimate economy. Burma also should step up efforts to enforce existing money laundering legislation by investigating and prosecuting money launderers. Moreover, Burma is urged to pass new legislation that would expand predicate crimes for money laundering and provide additional tools to authorities for the detection and prosecution of money laundering.

Cambodia (Concern). Cambodia is not a major financial center, and does not have an offshore sector. Cambodia is vulnerable to money laundering because it is a transit country for heroin trafficking from the Golden Triangle. Crime, corruption, and money laundering reportedly are on the increase in Cambodia.

Cambodia in 1996 criminalized money laundering related to narcotics trafficking through the Law on Drug Control. The law includes provisions for customer identification, suspicious transaction reporting, and the creation of the Anti-Money Laundering Commission (AMLC) under the Prime Minister's Office. The composition and functions of the AMLC were to be promulgated through a separate decree. The provisions of this law have yet to be fully implemented and enforced.

In December 1999, Cambodia passed legislation, ""The Law on Banking and Financial Institutions,"" that imposed capital and prudential requirements on financial institutions. Capital requirements for commercial banks will increase from US $5 million to US $13.5 million. Commercial banks also must maintain 20 percent of their capital on deposit with the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) as reserves. The law required the NBC to review all banking licenses within one year. Only four banks-all foreign-owned-have received licenses under the new law. An additional 15 banks will have a one-year grace period to meet licensing requirements.

Money laundering offenses are investigated by the same entities that have jurisdiction over the underlying predicate crimes. However, these entities are not trained to detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering cases.

Cambodia has assisted neighboring countries with money laundering investigations. Cambodia is not a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

The Government of Cambodia (GOC) should fully implement and enforce its anti-money laundering legislation. Moreover, the GOC should better educate officials and financial institutions about anti-money laundering methods.

Cameroon (Other). Cameroon is not a regional financial center. Although illicit drugs transit Cameroon, there is no information indicating significant money-laundering activity. Cameroon's banking system is supervised by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), a regional central bank that serves six countries of Central Africa.

In November 2000, Cameroon and the BEAC hosted a conference for BEAC member countries to devise joint structures and legal strategies for fighting money laundering.

Cameroon has not criminalized money laundering.

Cameroon is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000 signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Canada (Primary). Canada is neither a regional nor an offshore financial center. However, Canada remains vulnerable to money laundering because of its advanced financial services sector and heavy cross-border flow of currency and monetary instruments. Canada has financial institutions that engage in currency transactions involving international narcotics proceeds that include significant amounts of US dollars. Canada's financial institutions have been used to launder the proceeds of Latin American and Asian drug trafficking, and Asian organized crime. As a result of the common border between our two countries, strong and effective anti-money laundering enforcement is essential. The US Government is particularly concerned about the cross-border movements of currency.

The Government of Canada (GOC) continues to strengthen its anti-money laundering regime. In July 2000, the GOC passed the Proceeds of Money Laundering Control Act (PMLCA), which adopted enhancements recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 1999. The full effectiveness of this new legislation will not be known, however, until strong implementing regulations are put into place and enforced.

The PMLCA established the Financial Transaction and Reports Analysis Center (FinTRAC) on July 5, 2000. Under implementing regulations, FinTRAC will collect and analyze suspicious activities reports (SARs) from financial institutions and financial intermediaries, and determine which suspicious transactions merit further investigation. In addition, money service businesses, casinos, lawyers, and accountants handling third-party transactions are required to file SARs. The GOC expects that FinTRAC will be fully operational by mid-2001. The GOC presently is identifying managers and other staff for FinTRAC, and purchasing computer hardware and software. The GOC intends to have FinTRAC recognized by the Egmont Group as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). FinTRAC will have the authority to negotiate and set guidelines for sharing information with foreign counterparts. US law enforcement has expressed concerns that there may be legal impediments restricting FinTRAC's ability to share information. The PMLCA also mandates reporting of cross-border movements of currency or monetary instruments as will be defined in implementing regulations.

Canada is a member of the FATF, and underwent a second FATF mutual evaluation in May 1997. Canada is a member of the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering. Canada also participates in the CFATF as a Cooperating and Supporting Nation. Canada is an observer jurisdiction to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). Canada has long-standing agreements with the United States on law enforcement cooperation, including treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance. Canada is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

The GOC should ensure that the FinTRAC meets Egmont standards for FIUs, especially with regard to sharing information with other FIUs. The GOC also is urged to adopt and fully implement regulations that define cross-border currency reporting requirements.

Cayman Islands (Primary). The Cayman Islands, a United Kingdom (UK) Caribbean Overseas Territory (COT), remains vulnerable to money laundering because of its significant offshore sector that provides a wide range of services such as private banking, brokerage services, mutual funds, various types of trusts as well as company formation and company management. In March 2000, Cayman Islands authorities reported that approximately 570 banks and trust companies, 2,238 mutual funds, and 499 captive insurance companies were licensed in the Cayman Islands.

In addition, approximately 45,000 offshore companies are registered in the Cayman Islands.

In June 2000, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) identified the Cayman Islands as non-cooperative in international efforts to fight money laundering. The FATF in its report cited several concerns:

The Cayman Islands does not have any legal requirements for customer identification and record keeping. Even if in the absence of a mandatory requirement, financial institutions were to identify their customers, supervisory authorities cannot, as a matter of law, readily access information regarding the identity of customers. Moreover, the supervisory authority places too much reliance on home country supervisors' assessment of management of bank branches.

Although the Cayman Islands has criminalized the laundering of the proceeds of all serious crimes and its system encourages reporting of suspicious transactions (by providing a safe harbor from criminal liability for those who report), it lacks a mandatory regime for the reporting of suspicious transactions. Moreover, a large class of management companies-including those providing nominee shareholders for the purpose of formation of a company or holding the issued capital of a company-is unregulated.

At the same time, the Cayman Islands has been a leader in developing anti-money laundering programs throughout the Caribbean region. It has served as president of CFATF, and it has provided substantial assistance to neighboring states in the region. It has demonstrated co-operation on criminal law enforcement matters, and uncovered several serious cases of fraud and money laundering otherwise unknown to authorities in FATF member states. In addition, it has closed several financial institutions on the basis of concerns about money laundering.

In July 2000, the US Treasury Department issued an advisory to US financial institutions warning them to pay special attention to give ""enhanced scrutiny for certain transactions or banking relationships"" involving the Cayman Islands.

In 1999, the Cayman Islands and the other UK COTs agreed to undergo a comprehensive review of their financial regulation, and implement recommended changes. The results of this review were published in October 2000 and indicate that although the Cayman Islands has made progress, its current regulatory structure was still not fully in accordance with international standards. The primary recommendations of the report were:

The report also stressed the importance of addressing bearer shares, and noted that the Cayman Islands in 2001 plans to introduce legislation that would immobilize bearer shares. The report lauded the Cayman Islands' efforts to date in strengthening its anti-money laundering regime.

In 2000, the Cayman Islands approved regulations and legislation that were intended to address deficiencies in it anti-money laundering regime. Regulations that entered into force in September 2000 specified record keeping and customer identification requirements for financial institutions. The regulations specifically cover individuals who establish a new business relationship, engage in a one-time transaction over Cayman Islands (CI) $15,000, or may be engaging in money laundering. The customer identification requirements do not apply to existing accounts with financial intermediaries.

Amendments to the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Law (PCCL) make failure to report a suspicious transaction a criminal offense that could result in fines or imprisonment. The law does not specify a time frame in which suspicious transaction reports must be made, but instead, states that the transaction should be reported within a ""reasonably practicable"" timeframe once it comes to the person's attention.

Amendments to the Monetary Authority Law (MAL) grant the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) the power to obtain information from a person regulated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, a connected person, or a person reasonably believed to have information relevant to an inquiry by CIMA. The amendment includes provisions for identification of account holders and beneficial owners. However, CIMA can only obtain information about the identity of a client through a court order, which hinders CIMA's ability to detect, investigate, and take action against money laundering and the underlying offense. Further amendments to the MAL grant CIMA the authority to assist certain overseas regulators by sharing information in its files and obtaining client and other information from regulated and unregulated persons. CIMA's assistance is limited to overseas regulatory authorities that have the same functions as CIMA or those authorities ""as may be specified in regulations"" that have yet to be promulgated.

Also in 2000, the Cayman Islands passed the Banks and Trust Companies (Amendment) (Access to Information) Law, 2000, and the Companies Management (Amendment) (Access to Information) Law, 2000.

The Cayman Islands published a non-binding money laundering Code of Practice pursuant to Section 20 of the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Law (1999 Revision) to coincide with its hosting of the UN Offshore Plenary Forum of International Money Laundering. The Code of Practice is intended to give Cayman Islands financial service providers guidance about preventing and detecting money laundering. The code outlines procedures for identifying clients, training staff, documenting evidence, and maintaining records consistent with international standards. However, the Code does not create a legal obligation; therefore, failure to comply with its provisions does not constitute a legal offense.

The Cayman Islands cooperates with US law enforcement in money laundering cases. In 1999, the Cayman Islands did not prosecute anyone for money laundering; however, it did arrest several individuals on suspicion of money laundering.

The Cayman Islands, through the UK, is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. The Cayman Islands is a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors (OGBS). In addition, there is a 1986 US-UK Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) covering the Cayman Islands.

The Cayman Islands has made progress toward strengthening its anti-money laundering regime, and is urged to fully address all deficiencies that have been identified in its anti-money laundering regime. In particular, the Cayman Islands should follow through on its stated plans to immobilize bearer shares.

Chile (Concern). Chile has a well-developed financial sector, but is not considered a major regional financial center. Chile does not have an offshore sector. Chile continues to be vulnerable to money laundering because it lacks key legal provisions that aid in the prevention and detection of money laundering. According to press reports in April 2000, a Chilean Senate Finance Committee estimated that approximately US $10 billion is laundered annually through Chile. Money launderers reportedly exploit Chilean banks, commodities brokerages, and currency exchange businesses. Moreover, large real estate projects and casinos also are vulnerable to money laundering.

In 1995, Chile criminalized money laundering related to narcotics trafficking through the Counternarcotics Law. The law allows banks to voluntarily report suspicious or unusual financial transactions. However, the legislation has no ""safe harbor"" provisions that protect banks from potential civil or criminal liability. As a result, reporting of such transactions has been extremely low. Moreover, the legislation does not require reporting of large currency transactions. In December 1999, the Government of Chile (GOC) proposed legislation that would amend the Counternarcotics Law by mandating reporting of suspicious financial transactions, and creating a new financial intelligence unit to replace the existing FIU. However, the proposed legislation would not expand predicate crimes for money laundering. The Chilean Congress has not approved the legislation.

Chile's Judicial Reform Law of 1997 gives both the Council for the Defence of the State (CDE) and the Public Ministry responsibility for investigating money laundering cases. This joint arrangement will continue for at least two years. The pending amendments to the Counternarcotics Law would give the Public Ministry sole responsibility for implementing the new law when it is promulgated.

Chile is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Chile is a member of the Organization of American States Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) Experts Group to Control Money Laundering, and the newly created South American Financial Action Task Force (GAFISUD). Chile's current financial intelligence unit, the Departmento de Control de Trafico Ilicito de Estupefacientes, is a member of the Egmont Group.

In August 2000, Chile and the United States signed an agreement for cooperation and mutual assistance in narcotics-related matters. Chile has similar agreements in force with the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Czech Republic. Bilateral agreement negotiations are underway with France, Germany, Russia, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, Tunisia, Guatemala, and Honduras.

The GOC is urged to pass anti-money laundering legislation that would mandate reporting of both suspicious and large currency transactions by financial institutions, provide ""safe harbor"" protections to entities that report such transactions, and expand predicate offenses for money laundering to include all serious crimes. Moreover, the COG should ensure that its FIU has the authority and resources necessary to make it an effective force against money laundering, and that it can readily share information with international counterparts.

China, People's Republic of (Primary). In response to the growing threat of money laundering, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has begun to focus greater attention on improving the country's anti-money laundering regime. The State Council (Cabinet) has directed various government agencies to examine their current anti-money laundering measures and to draft new regulations for the commercial banking, regulatory, and enforcement sectors. The government views an enhanced anti-money laundering regime as a means to stem the rise in financial crime and corruption. Narcotics trafficking, smuggling, extortion, alien smuggling, and the counterfeiting of currency and goods remain major sources of illegal proceeds in the PRC. Foreign and domestic organized criminal activity, endemic corruption at the provincial and local levels, and the continued presence of anonymous bank accounts contribute to the PRC's money-laundering problem.

The PRC's efforts to address money laundering began in 1990, when the National People's Congress (NPC) adopted the country's first law criminalizing narcotics-related money laundering and allowed the confiscation of narcotics proceeds. In 1997, the NPC adopted the PRC's current Criminal Code, Article 191, which makes it a crime to launder the proceeds of narcotics trafficking, organized criminal activity, and smuggling. Efforts are underway to draft amendments to the Code that would expand the definition of predicate offenses for money laundering to include the proceeds of all criminal activity. In addition to Article 191, Article 312 of the Criminal Code criminalizes complicity in concealing the proceeds of criminal activity.

As in many civil law-based countries, the PRC charges each offense separately, and defendants who have laundered the proceeds of a predicate crime usually are prosecuted for the predicate offense rather than money laundering because the predicate offense generally carries a heavier penalty and is easier to prove. The sentences handed down by tribunals in 2000 illustrate the severity of punishment. Several dozen senior officials at both the national and provincial levels were sentenced to death for corruption and smuggling.

The PRC took additional steps in 2000 to combat money laundering. In April 2000, the PRC passed a statute that requires anyone opening a new bank account to do so in his or her true name. When opening or depositing money into a new account, the customer must produce an identification card to verify his or her identity. Existing anonymous accounts may remain open for five years from the time of the account's establishment. After five years, the account holder must re-register the account in his or her true name only. Anonymous accounts will be phased out in 2005.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC)--China's central bank--has issued internal regulations that require currency transaction reports for all transactions involving Renminbi (RMB) 50,000 (US $6,000) or more. The PBOC also has issued rules concerning the recording and reporting of currency transactions at the county level, as well as a circular to Chinese banks regarding the reporting of suspicious transactions. Withdrawals of RMB 200,000 (US $24,000), deposits of RMB one million (US $120,000), or a series of aggregate transactions totaling RMB one million must be reported to the PBOC. At the county level, withdrawals of RMB 50,000 (US $6,000) require picture identification. However, central bank supervisors do not verify compliance with these rules.

In addition, the PRC has foreign currency exchange controls. Commercial banks require PRC citizens to justify the exchange of RMB into a foreign currency. The maximum amount of foreign currency that a PRC citizen may take out of the PRC is US $2,000. For foreigners, the threshold is US $5,000. Requests for exchanges of currency above these thresholds require advance certification through documentation of the need for the foreign currency, such as for foreign travel or commerce.

The United States and the PRC continue to discuss cooperation on money laundering and other law enforcement topics under the auspices of the US-PRC Joint Liaison Group (JLG) on law enforcement cooperation. The last JLG meeting took place in June 2000 in Beijing. In 2000, US enforcement and regulatory agencies hosted several law enforcement delegations from China to discuss money laundering and financial crimes. In addition, the US Departments of Treasury and Justice conducted various training seminars in the PRC featuring the enforcement and prosecutorial aspects of money laundering.

In October 2000, an interagency US Government team visited the PRC to assess the need for training to help PRC authorities combat money laundering. The team will make recommendations on future training.

The United States and the PRC in June 2000 signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA), which contains general obligations to cooperate in criminal matters. The agreement is not yet in force. The PRC is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and in December 2000, signed the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The PRC is a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering.

As the PRC examines ways to enhance its anti-money laundering regime, consideration should be given to criminalizing money laundering for all serious crimes, and abolishing anonymous accounts prior to 2005. The PRC also should adopt comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation that establishes appropriate mechanisms for prevention, detection, and enforcement.

Colombia (Primary). Colombia has financial institutions that engage in currency transactions involving international narcotics proceeds that include significant amounts of US dollars. As the world's largest production and distribution source for cocaine and a significant supplier of heroin to the United States, Colombia has a natural vulnerability to drug money laundering. Pervasive commercial smuggling for tax and import duty avoidance, arms trafficking related to violent paramilitary groups and guerrilla organizations, along with continued capital flight from Colombia's fragile economy, are among additional factors that exacerbate the money laundering threat in Colombia. Trade-based money laundering, such as the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE), through which money launderers furnish narcotics-generated dollars in the United States to commercial smugglers, travel agents, investors and others in exchange for Colombian Pesos in Colombia, is a prominent method for laundering narcotics proceeds. Colombia also appears to be a significant destination and transit location for bulk shipment of narcotics-related United States currency, while the use of wire remitters and transactions involving precious metals and stones are believed to play significant roles in drug money laundering through Colombia. Smart cards and other financial sector technology represent growing challenges to money laundering enforcement in Colombia.

Although important reforms are needed to enhance law enforcement efforts, Colombia has significant legal authority to combat money laundering. Colombia has criminalized the laundering of the proceeds of extortion, illicit enrichment, rebellion, and drug trafficking. Colombia's 1996 extinction of domain forfeiture legislation provides for criminal forfeiture of drug money laundering proceeds, in rem forfeiture when assets are held in the name of a nominee or have been transferred, and forfeiture of substitute assets. Originally created by executive decree in 1998, Colombia formally adopted legislation in 1999 to establish a unified central Financial Information and Analysis Unit (UIAF) within the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit with broad authority to access and analyze financial information from public and private entities in Colombia. Additional forfeiture authority in criminal prosecutions is more generally available elsewhere in the Colombian criminal code.

In addition, the Superintendency of Banks has instituted ""know your customer"" regulations for the entities it regulates, including banks, insurance companies, trust companies, insurance agents and brokers, and leasing companies. Among other things, the Superintendency of Banks also has authority to rescind licenses for wire remitters. As a result of regulations issued in 2000, the Superintendency of Securities, which oversees Colombia's three stock exchanges, also will soon begin instituting anti-money laundering compliance procedures. However, the Colombian central bank's new External Resolution No. 8 issued in May 2000 relaxed certain requirements on individuals conducting currency exchange services, enabling them simply to identify this service when registering their business but eliminating the need for them to become fully licensed. Financial institutions and wire remitters are required to file suspicious activity reports, while currency transactions and cross-border movements of currency in excess of US $10,000 must also be reported. In addition, casas de cambio must file currency reports for transactions involving US $700 or more, while wire remitters must pay withdrawals over US $3000 by check.

The Prosecutor General's office established a specialized task force unit of agents and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute money laundering cases and forfeiture actions under the 1996 Extinction of Domain statute. Recent reductions in the rate of turnover among members of the unit may bring some stability to the office and increase its effectiveness. Including convictions under prior offenses of criminal reception and illicit enrichment, this unit has obtained criminal sentences in 33 money laundering related cases and has more than 200 active cases pending. Colombian authorities have seized more than 10,000 properties in more than 250 forfeiture actions, although Colombia has obtained forfeiture judgments in just twelve cases.

The UIAF receives an average of 500 suspicious activity reports (SARs) per month, totaling nearly 15,000 received since December of 1998. However, only thirteen of these SARs have been forwarded to the Prosecutor General's office for enforcement and only a handful of those forwarded have been accepted for further investigation or prosecution.

Colombia played a significant role in multilateral efforts to combat money laundering in 2000. In December, Colombia was the host of the inaugural meeting of GAFISUD, a South American regional anti-money laundering organization modeled after the Financial Action Task Force. Colombia also participated in a multilateral initiative with the Governments of the United States, Venezuela, Panama, and Aruba designed to address the problem of trade-based money laundering through the BMPE among the participating countries. In addition, in 2000 Colombia's UIAF became a new member of the Egmont Group.

During 2000, the United States and Colombia have continued to expand bilateral cooperation against money laundering. Among the eleven Colombian citizens extradited to the United States in 2000 were two wanted on money laundering charges. An additional seven persons indicted on money laundering charges were provisionally arrested in Colombia pursuant to United States requests for extradition. Colombia has also provided important continuing assistance to United States civil forfeiture actions against accounts in Colombia restrained in 1998 and 1999 in response to United States formal requests for assistance in Operations Juno and Casablanca. Colombia's Tax and Customs Directorate (DIAN) also provided valuable case-related assistance and training to United States prosecutors and agents in 2000.

In 2000, Colombia adopted a new criminal and criminal procedure code. These measures expand money laundering predicates to include conspiracy and corruption. However, this legislation, which does not come into effect until June of 2001, is under constitutional challenge. Additional legislation still pending would permit the disclosure of tax information to law enforcement for criminal investigation purposes.

The United States' July, 2000 appropriations in support of Plan Colombia are anticipated to provide meaningful assistance for money laundering and forfeiture prosecutions in 2001. These funds are expected to provide significant training and equipment investments for the Office of the Prosecutor General, the UIAF, the asset management program of the National Drug Directorate (DNE), and DIAN, among other things.",1
394,"Vast Web Hides Mexican Drug Profits in Plain Sight, U.S. Authorities Say","TLAJOMULCO, Mexico — The United States calls Hugo Cuéllar Hurtado a longtime trafficker of the cocaine coming from South America, working with one of the men believed to command Mexico’s biggest drug cartel now that its leader, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, has been captured.

But while Mr. Guzmán — known as El Chapo, or Shorty — spent 13 years on the run, sometimes even escaping through underground tunnels dug under bathrooms, Mr. Cuéllar walks freely around Guadalajara, attending luncheons and chatting up diplomats. He says he even won a government grant for an ostrich farm he runs here.

“Let them come and investigate me,” he said leisurely over a breakfast of ostrich steaks and sausages at his 57-acre ranch, which the Treasury Department just designated a money-laundering pit for Mr. Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel. “I have nothing to hide.”

If arresting the cartel’s leader proved to be a 13-year challenge, requiring extensive cooperation between Mexican and American authorities, then cracking the financial network sheltering the Sinaloa cartel’s money, estimated to be several billion dollars, may be just as tough.",1
85,Alibaba executive Liu in corruption probe for role with Tencent,"image copyrightReuters

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has said its senior executive Patrick Liu is in police custody over corruption allegations related to his previous job with internet company Tencent.

Tencent confirmed that up to six former employees were under investigation in an ongoing anti-graft probe.

China's biggest social network said an ""internal investigation"" brought to light bribery allegations.

Several executives have been implicated in China's corruption crackdown.

The government has been on a drive to reform the economy, the world's second largest, by clamping down on corruption in major institutions and businesses for the past two years.

Tencent has not identified the former employees, but said that ""the police have been notified"" and they were awaiting further information.

'Nothing to do with Alibaba'

Alibaba confirmed to the Reuters news agency that Mr Lui was detained but the case was ""related to his time at Tencent and has nothing to do with Alibaba"".

Mr Liu left Tencent for competitor Alibaba in 2013 to become the president of its digital entertainment unit.

Tencent is behind China's popular messaging app, WeChat. It also owns China's largest music streaming service by subscribers and its online gaming business has been compared to that of Nintendo's and Sony's gaming units.

Alibaba also has a large stake in Weibo, a social media site similar to Twitter as well as Chinese online video providers similar to YouTube.

China's anti-corruption crackdown has targeted both government officials as well as company executives with many being taken into custody.",1
591,Slimmer AI raises €4 million to continue fight against financial crime,"Slimmer AI has raised €4 million from a group of long-term strategic investors and experienced fintech entrepreneurs.

The company uses AI to fight financial crime and has already screened financial transactions with an underlying value of €20 billion since going live in October. This investment will largely be used to accelerate the development of Sentinels, its anti-money laundering, fraud and credit risk software solution.

“The fight against financial crime continues to be a top priority for both governments and financial institutions, especially with the current rapid increase in online transactions and merchants. The access to additional capital, as well as the expertise and experience of our investors, will allow us to rapidly scale up,” said JC Heyneke, CEO.

318,FBI: BEC scams accounted for half of the cyber-crime losses in 2019,"The FBI received 467,361 internet and cyber-crime complaints in 2019, which the agency estimates have caused losses of more than $3.5 billion, the bureau wrote in its yearly internet crime report released today.

The FBI said that almost half of the reported losses -- an estimated $1.77 billion -- came from reports of BEC (Business Email Compromise), also known as EAC (Email Account Compromise) crimes.

BEC/EAC is a sophisticated scam targeting businesses and individuals performing wire transfer payments.

""At its heart, BEC relies on the oldest trick in the con artist's handbook: deception,"" the FBI said back in 2017, when it started receiving an increased number of BEC scams reports.

A typical BEC scam happens after hackers either compromise or spoof an email account for a legitimate person/company. They use this email account to send fake invoices or business contractors. These are sent to employees in the same company, or upstream/downstream business partners.

The idea is to trick counterparts into wiring money into the wrong bank accounts.

BEC scams are popular because they're (1) dead simple to execute, and (2) don't require advanced coding skills or complex malware.

According to the FBI's 2019 Internet Crime Report, BEC scams were, by a considerable margin, the most damaging and effective type of cyber-crime last year in 2019.

Only 23,775 BEC victim accounted for $1.77 billion in losses for victims, which is on average $75,000/complaint.

In comparison, phishing/smishing/vishing accounted for $500 in losses per complaint, while ransomware averaged $4,400.

""In 2019, the IC3 observed an increase in the number of BEC/EAC complaints related to the diversion of payroll funds,"" the FBI said.

""In this type of scheme, a company's human resources or payroll department receives an email appearing to be from an employee requesting to update their direct deposit information for the current pay period. The new direct deposit information generally routes to a pre-paid card account.""

Ransomware situation

Another point of interest in the FBI's internet crime report for 2019 was ransomware. Last year, we saw a decrease in the number of complaints and a rise in the amount of losses caused by ransomware incidents.

This year, losses continued to increase, but the number of ransomware incidents spiked right back up. All in all, the report's findings are surprising.

2019 has been a year flooded with news about ransomware infections hitting left and right. Companies in the private sector, managed service providers, schools, and municipalities have been hit the most.

According to reports from Armor and Emsisoft, ransomware crew took US entities in their sights last year. Emsisoft reported that ransomware hit in 2019:

113 state and municipal governments and agencies.
764 healthcare providers.
89 universities, colleges and school districts, with operations at up to 1,233 individual schools potentially affected.

While not all entities might have filed reports with the FBI's IC3, the FBI's report reflects what we've seen from independent third-party reporting.

2018 was a down year for ransomware gangs as there was a general shift in tactics from mass-email distribution to individual attacks targeted at a very few, but very high-profile targets.

As ransomware these new mode of operation became more popular in 2019, new ransomware gangs joined the fold, increasing the number of attacks we saw in 2018.

According to multiple experts, both BEC and ransomware attacks are expected to continue to rise in 2020, as there's little to deter cyber-crime groups from launching new operations.",0
291,Latin America: Donations to Public Administration in Latin America,"In view of the health crisis in Latin America following to the outbreak of COVID-19, as well as the economic and social impacts of this situation, many people and companies have expressed interest in collaborating with the governments to support their goal of preventing and controlling the spread of the virus.

558,The President,"Sergio Mattarella was born in Palermo on 23 July 1941. He has three children.

In 1964 he obtained a summa con laude Law Degree from “La Sapienza” University of Rome with a dissertation on: “Public Policy Guidelines”. He was admitted to the Palermo Bar Association in 1967.

He taught parliamentary law at the Law School of the University of Palermo until 1983, when he took leave of absence upon being elected member of the Chamber of Deputies.

Most of his scientific research and publications have focussed on constitutional law (the role of the Regional Government of Sicily in the economy, bicameralism, legislative process, parliamentary scrutiny, compensation for expropriation, evolution of Sicily’s regional administration, oversight over local government). Other publications have been on subjects linked to his activity in parliament and government. He has been a speaker at conferences on law studies and has held lectures at Masters and postgraduate courses in several universities.

His political experience originated in the Catholic social and reform movement. In 1983 he was elected to Parliament for the Christian Democracy Party in the western Sicily constituency and remained a member of the Chamber of Deputies until 2008.

During these seven parliamentary terms he was member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Legislative Commission, which he also chaired.

He was also member of the Bicameral Committee for Institutional Reform of the XI Legislature (and its Deputy Chairman), of the Bicameral Committee for Institutional Reform of the XIII Legislature, of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry on Terrorism and Massacres, and of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry on the Mafia. In the XV Legislature he was Chairman of the Jurisdictional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

In the XIII Legislature he was Leader of the People’s and Democratic Parties Parliamentary Group (from the beginning of the parliamentary term to October 1998).

From July 1987 to July 1989 he was Minister for Relations with Parliament. During his mandate, legislative reform of the Prime Minister’s Office was enacted and secret ballot voting in Parliament was discontinued as the standard procedure. He was Minister of Education from July 1989 to July 1990. During his term in office the National Conference on Schools was held in January 1990 and a primary school reform was implemented introducing a “module” with three teachers for two classes (Act No. 148 of 1990).

He became Deputy Prime Minister in October 1998 and Minister of Defence from December 1999 to the June 2001 elections. During his mandate, laws were enacted to abolish conscription and to turn the Carabinieri into an autonomous armed force. In those years, Italy stepped up its involvement in UN peace missions and contributed significantly to the interposition and peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. During that period, Italy strongly supported the establishment of the European Security and Defence Policy, which led to the creation of the first European Army Corps.

He did not run for the 2008 political elections and ended his political activity.

In May 2009 Parliament elected him member of the Bureau’s Council for Administrative Justice, of which he was elected Deputy Chairman.

On 5 October 2011 he was elected Constitutional Judge by Parliament and was sworn in as member of the Constitutional Court on 11 October 2011.",0
438,Turkey wants Aguila Saleh Issa to replace Haftar in Libyan negotiations,"Turkey sees head of Libya's Tobruk-based parliament Aguila Saleh Issa as a viable negotiations partner and wants him to represent the eastern bloc instead of Khalifa Haftar, a Turkish envoy said in an exclusive interview with Middle East Eye.

“Haftar is a failed dictator and we have never recognised him as a legitimate actor. He is also about to lose the Russian support. He won’t take a place in the future of Libya,” said Emrullah Isler, the Turkish special presidential envoy to Libya.

“Political negotiations should be conducted by the politicians. Aguila Saleh Issa, as a politician, specifically must contribute to this process.”

Turkey politically and militarily supports the Tripoli-based and UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) against Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which is allied to the eastern Tobruk parliament.

Despite a UN weapons embargo, Turkey signed a military cooperation deal with the GNA and sent drones, armoured vehicles, Syrian mercenaries and military officers to support the government, which was struggling to fight off Haftar's UAE-, Egypt- and Russia-backed forces.

Strategic airbase Al-Watiya was recaptured by the GNA last month with the help of Turkish military assistance, one of a series of victories against the LNA that has seen the eastern commander's offensive in western Libya crumble.

Haftar, who in April declared himself sole ruler of Libya, saw his 14-month assault on Tripoli finally dissolve earlier this month, leaving questions about his future.

Isler said the Tobruk parliament was a legitimate branch of the Libyan state under the UN-recognised political deal signed in 2015, and noted that Saleh, whom he met previously in 2017, had been elected as its speaker. The UN-brokered deal that instated the GNA collapsed in 2016, leaving Libya with two warring adminstrations ever since.

“We opened our doors to everybody. I have personally visited eastern Libya three times over the years and always worked for a political solution,” Isler said. “I believe Aguila Saleh should carry out this role in a positive manner.”

Further gains needed

Cairo earlier this month called for a ceasefire in Libya, with a declaration signed by Haftar and Saleh, yet no other actor has recognised it.

Isler said Haftar has repeatedly declined to abide by ceasefires over the last year, and his word couldn’t be taken as granted.

“In order to begin the political negotiations and reach a ceasefire, the GNA believes further territorial gains are needed. Their priority is Sirte and Jufra,” Isler said. “Sirte was only lost a couple of months ago. So they believe it needs to be recaptured. And Jufra is a strategic base that hosts a military aiport.""

The Turkish foreign ministry announced on Sunday that a high-level Russian delegation’s visit to discuss a ceasefire had been postponed due to immediate disagreements.

Isler believes the main issue between the two countries is the fact that the GNA isn’t planning to return to the table without the capture of Sirte and Jufra.

'In order to begin the political negotiations and reach a ceasefire, the GNA believes further territorial gains are needed. Their priority is Sirte and Jufra'

“Both sides know each other's positions. Talks will continue,” he said.

The Russians last month deployed several fighter jets in Jufra to support Haftar's forces. It isn't clear what would happen if GNA-allied forces reach the area.

Several reports on Arab media earlier this month said Egyptian officials were disappointed by Haftar and Cairo was looking for a way out.

Isler said Egypt could begin to contribute to the political negotiations by reaching out to the GNA, as long as Cairo agrees to support a democratically elected civilian government in Libya that would protect its territorial unity.

“Egypt should immediately talk to the legitimate government to overcome its legitimate security concerns,” he said. “They need to provide support for the negotiations.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that Turkey and the GNA intended to deepen their relationship in upcoming days.

Several reports this week suggested that Turkey was going to establish a drone base in al-Watiya and a naval base in Misrata, as well as develop extensive cooperation on reconstruction and oil drilling.

Isler said both countries could work together in all of these areas and Turkish companies are expected to join the rebuilding efforts, with much of the country devestated by nine years of conflict and upheaval.",0
133,JPMorgan investigates employees over potential misuse of PPP loans,"New York (CNN Business) JPMorgan Chase is investigating the role its employees may have played in potential abuse of Paycheck Protection Program loans and other pandemic relief programs.

In a memo to staff on Tuesday, JPMorgan (JPM) urged employees to be ""vigilant"" about fraud involving government stimulus programs.

The probe was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, said it has seen ""conduct that does not live up to our business and ethical principles — and may even be illegal."" The company said it is working to identify the abuse and cooperating with law enforcement.

The memo, signed by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other top executives, said that includes ""instances of customers misusing"" PPP loans, unemployment benefits and other programs.

""Some employees have fallen short, too,"" the bank said.

JPMorgan urged employees to ""say something"" if they see improper conduct, including reporting confidentially to managers or through the bank's conduct hot line: ""We take each report seriously and will take action, including disciplinary, when warranted.""

It's not clear whether any charges have been filed, nor whether JPMorgan has already taken disciplinary action against employees. The bank declined to comment beyond the memo.

Congress and the White House approved a record-breaking $2 trillion stimulus package in March to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic. The federal relief package included forgivable loans in the PPP program designed to keep afloat small businesses hurt by the health crisis.

JPMorgan alone has funded more than 280,000 PPP loans totaling more than $32 billion.

In recent months, federal authorities have unsealed charges against individuals who allegedly abused PPP loans. Last month, the Justice Department accused nearly a dozen people of participating in a ""large scale"" and ""organized"" effort to misuse PPP funds.

""Unfortunately, the rapid injection of trillions of dollars in PPP loans into the economy has created a very high risk for fraud at a time when many organizations and their employees are already operating under the kind of intense financial pressure that often leads to fraud and embezzlement,"" John Warren, general counsel for the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.

Seventy-six perfect of certified fraud examiners expect a rise in loan fraud over the next year, according to an ACFE survey.

In July, authorities accused a man in Miami with bank fraud for allegedly lying on PPP loan applications and spending the money on a $318,000 Lamborghini and other luxury purchases.",0
44,Germany's 'fat years' of high tax revenue are over: Finance Minister Scholz,"Germany's ""fat years"" of higher-than-expected revenue from tax receipts are over, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz warned on Sunday, signaling that Europe's top economy is set to lose momentum in the next few years.

""The good times in which the state kept taking in more taxes than expected are coming to an end,"" Scholz told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. That, he said, restricted the government's capacity for passing new tax cuts or increasing public investment.

Germany was, however, expected to post another budget surplus in 2018, Scholz said, after it posted a €36.6 billion ($41.7 billion) surplus in 2017.

The German government has spent less than it has received in tax revenues in every fiscal year since 2014 as a result of strong economic growth, high wages and record-low unemployment.

Scholz, a Social Democrat (SPD), cited the predicted fall in tax revenue as a reason for why he opposed abolishing the ""Solidarity Surcharge,"" a controversial tax designed to help finance development projects in eastern states that were part of communist East Germany.

The SPD's coalition partners, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have called for ending the surcharge by 2021.

Economic contraction in 2018

Germany's economic outlook appears fragile after the economy contracted for the first time in more than three years in the third quarter of 2018. In response, the government cut its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.5-1.6 percent, down from the 2.2 percent expansion registered for 2017.

Ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, problems in the German car industry and uncertainty about the United Kingdom's planned exit from the European Union have all contributed to the slow down.

Scholz, who succeeded veteran CDU finance chief Wolfgang Schäuble in early 2018, has vowed to uphold his predecessor's ""black zero"" policy of maintaining a balanced federal budget.

That policy has angered Germany's European peers and some international organizations, which have called on Berlin to increase public investment to help rectify the country's massive trade surplus with the rest of the world.

121,US Treasury outlines plans to modernise AML rules,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury today issued the 2020 National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing (2020 Strategy), which provides a roadmap to modernize the U.S. anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime to make it more effective and efficient.

The 2020 Strategy identifies key threats, vulnerabilities, and priorities for disrupting and preventing illicit finance activities within and transiting the U.S. financial system, and builds upon and updates the 2018 National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, pursuant to the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017 (CAATSA).

“The 2020 National Illicit Finance Strategy identifies key illicit finance vulnerabilities and provides solutions that will adapt our AML/CFT regime to future challenges,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “This whole-of-government approach provides a roadmap for a number of significant regulatory reforms designed to modernize our AML/CFT framework.”

The 2020 Strategy represents a comprehensive effort by the Trump Administration to assess key 21st century illicit finance challenges and identify solutions 50 years after the passage of the first AML/CFT law in the United States, the Bank Secrecy Act. The 2020 Strategy articulates three strategic priorities:

1) Increasing transparency and closing gaps in the U.S. AML/CFT legal framework;

2) Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the U.S. AML/CFT regulatory and supervisory framework for financial institutions; and

3) Enhancing current AML/CFT operational capabilities.

These three priorities are supported by a number of enabling actions, including legislative proposals on beneficial ownership, expanding AML/CFT obligations to certain “uncovered” financial institutions and supporting responsible AML/CFT innovation and augmenting public-private partnerships.

The 2020 Strategy, as well as the 2018 National Risk Assessments, identifies the most significant illicit finance threats, vulnerabilities, and risks facing the United States.

Financial institutions will find these documents helpful in informing their own risk assessments, and examiners will be able to use them in assessing whether AML/CFT compliance is tailored to the risks faced by their supervised entities.

Other U.S. Government agencies, including law enforcement agencies and policymakers, will also find that the 2020 Strategy and 2018 National Risk Assessments inform a risk-based approach to their work that is flexible enough to address threats in real time.

This is consistent with efforts currently underway in forums such as the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group, where regulators, law enforcement, and the private sector are looking at ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the U.S. AML/CFT framework.

The National Illicit Finance Strategy was prepared by the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, in consultation with the many agencies, bureaus, and departments of the federal government that also have roles in combating illicit finance.",0

611,Coca-Cola is discontinuing Tab after nearly 60 years,"(CNN) RIP, Tab.

After nearly 60 years, Coca-Cola is discontinuing its first-ever diet soda, Tab, which acquired a huge fan base in the '70s and '80s and maintained a small but devoted following through the years.

""Tab had an amazing run,"" said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition and a longtime Tab enthusiast. Bixby said messages of condolences have been pouring in. ""As a business decision I can understand it, but it's a very sad day ... I do feel it's like losing a friend.""

Tab is one of several""underperforming"" products Coke has said it is eliminating from its brand lineup by the end of the year as the company seeks to streamline production and focus on bestsellers.

Coke isn't alone in culling its brand lineup. Many food and beverage companies are cutting back on their product offerings during the pandemic to make their operations more efficient and meet growing demand for their most popular items.

The company said its beverage overhaul was already under way before Covid-19, but the pandemic prompted the company to fast-track changes. Coke previously announced that Odwalla juices and Zico coconut water would be among the discontinued brands.

Bixby, who has remained loyal to Tab since the 1970s, said he had been preparing for the end. He said he's been auditioning replacement diet colas all summer — all too sweet.

The saccharine-sweetened, zero-calorie Tab was initially marketed to women. Some people familiar with the flavor have described it in terms including ""bitter"" and ""like bad medicine,"" with a metallic and lingering aftertaste. Though Bixby said he preferred it to other diet colas because it was less sweet. ""It didn't compete with things, so you could enjoy it with a meal.""

Tab's growth was more or less cannibalized when Diet Coke came on the scene in 1982. But Coke kept the brand alive for years for its devotees.

In announcing Tab's end, Coke noted the zero-calorie sparkling beverage category has changed significantly in recent years, both in terms of its core consumer base and preferences. Retiring products like Tab frees the company to invest in its powerhouse Diet Coke and Coke Zero brands.

""This is not a bottom-line efficiency play,"" said Brad Spickert, senior vice president of innovation and commercialization. ""It's a top-line growth play.""

Bixby says he's drinking more diet ginger ale these days, and holding out hope for some kind of Tab comeback as a novelty item.

""I had a pretty good stockpile at the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said. But earlier this year, he could no longer find Tab in stores or online. Now, he has just two cans left. ""I'll probably drink one, and save the other one in perpetuity.""",0
273,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Appointed a New Cabinet Headed by Hussein ARNOUS","On August 30, 2020, the Syrian President Bashar al-ASSAD signed the decree no. 210 for 2020 appointing a new cabinet headed by Hussein ARNOUS without changing the heads of so-called “sovereign” portfolios.

According to the president’s chancellery, the new government will be led by Prime Minister Hussein ARNOUS, who had served as the head of the cabinet since June 11, 2020, after former prime minister Imad KHAMIS resigned.

Hussein ARNOUS was born in Idleb in 1953 and graduated from the Faculty of Civil Engineering at the University of Aleppo in 1978. He headed the Engineers Syndicate branch in Idleb from 1989 to 1994 and was appointed Governor of Deir Ezzor from 2009 until 2011 and Governor of Quneitra in 2011, in addition to being a member of the central leadership of al-Baath Arab Socialist Party since 2013.

In the previous government, ARNOUS was minister of Syria’s water resources from 2018.

Under the decree, Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ali Abdullah AYYOUB maintain his post in the new cabinet.

The foreign and interior ministers, Walid MUALLEM and Mohammad Khaled al-RAHMOUN, will also continue fulfilling their duties.

The new finance minister is Kenan YAGI.

The Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources and Minister of Industry will be Bassam TUOME and Ziyad SABBAG.

The new Minister of Agriculture and Agricultural Reform is Muhammed Khassan KATNAN.

The new Syrian government was set up after the July 19, 2020, elections to the People’s Council. The National Unity bloc secured victory in the polls. It is led by the Arab Socialist Baath Party, where President Bashar ASSAD is Secretary-General.

ARNOUS is now the head of a government that must grapple with a coronavirus pandemic that is sparking alarm among medics and aid groups.

It’s expected that the new cabinet will make big changes to the ministers involved in the economic sector (economy, industry, and agriculture) because it will be a priority.

The ARNOUS government has a number of 6 women instead of 4 as previously, the number of Christians increased from 3 to 4 and the average age of ministers will be reduced, and for the first time, there will be people under the age of 40.

The prime minister’s official title is the head of the Council of Ministers. He is not the head of the ministers because according to the constitution the president is the head of the executive branch.",0
235,Elliptic takes in $5M for its blockchain forensics tool,"UK fintech startup Elliptic has pulled in a $5 million Series A round to keep building out its blockchain forensics tool. Its transaction-tracing technology mines the public Bitcoin ledger to identify and flag up suspicious transaction patterns within the distributed digital currency — offering the promise of combating Bitcoin-powered money laundering and other criminal activity.

Elliptic was founded back in 2013, amid much Bitcoin hype, and initially launched a Bitcoin storage product, in July 2014, taking in $2 million from Octopus Investments at the time.

That was a way for it to test the waters in a nascent space, says CEO and co-founder James Smith. He notes the founding team combines technical backgrounds with fintech expertise and saw early disruptive promise in Bitcoin/blockchain — albeit they weren’t immediately sure how it would shake out.

“We’re a startup, and you have to look around and see what the industry’s doing and find what you’re best suited to,” Smith tells TechCrunch. “When we first looked at Bitcoin we saw it both from the financial point of view, but also the technical point of view. And saw that there was going to be something to this.

“We wanted to jump in and start getting to know the industry, so we started we something fairly basic — which was the storage. Which is hard to do right but it’s not super hard and it’s not so much a technology solution as more of an operations solution. But it was something to get out feet wet and to start to get to know the industry and figure out what was really required.”

What it learn was that compliance was becoming an increasing pain-point for larger (legal) entities in the Bitcoin space, as the regulatory regime around the digital currency matured.

To address this need Elliptic built and launched its first blockchain analytics product last summer, and now has “in the region of 10 to 20” Bitcoin companies using it — which Smith describes as pretty much every large player in the Bitcoin ecosystem in the US and Europe.

“We started with a problem, and the technology came next,” he says. “The first product was for companies in the Bitcoin space who are transacting a lot of Bitcoin — so it’s the exchanges, payment providers and so on. They’ve got a responsibility to satisfy regulation. That’s particular in the States and in Europe where AML [anti-money laundering] regulation is more strict. And it’s particularly for the larger and better funded companies who have the most regulatory scrutiny.”

Elliptic has since also expanded its customer focus to encompass law enforcement agencies, offering a tool to help them acquire evidence connecting criminal entities through the Bitcoin network. Smith says it now has about five U.S. law enforcement agencies plus a few others across Europe using its tool.

On the competition side, he names Chainalysis and Block Seer as main rivals but argues they are more focused on law enforcement vs the core compliance imperative driving Elliptic.

How Elliptic’s technology works involves tracing transactions via the public Bitcoin ledger in order to be able to connect different entities by creating a template of linkages. And while it has to do some labeling of Bitcoin addresses itself, to make sketching such a picture of interesting activity possible, it’s more acting as a connective tissue layer for its customers — by joining up, for example, Bitcoin address data held by a BTC exchange with a suspicious series of transactions unearthed by its pattern-spotting technology.

Smith notes that suspicious patterns might initially be identified by a (human) compliance officer, employed by one of its customers, with its machine learning algorithms then using that data to spot variations and multiple instances of the same patterns.

You can start to build up a real view of how real world entities are interacting with each other within this ledger. And that’s quite a powerful tool.

“By looking at the patterns of transactions and how they interact, over time we can start building up a picture of which transactions are associated with which entities,” he explains, noting that links could be similar spending patterns as well as direct connections between different Bitcoin addresses. “You can start to build up a real view of how real world entities are interacting with each other within this ledger. And that’s quite a powerful tool.”

“Our focus is on particularly criminal entities within this world. And so we do a lot of data gathering to start to identify who those transactors are — so we go and gather a lot of information from the dark web particularly, but also from the clear web and other sources — to start building up data points that help us label that view of the world that we have.

“And then we can start saying ok now I see that that entity there is really the Silk Road and I can see that the funds flow from the Silk Road to this guy, to that guy, to a few different places and then they’ve tried to cash out at an exchange.”

And no, its mission is not to make every Bitcoin transaction and every address holder radically transparent, confirms Smith. It’s about targeting its data gathering and labeling for specific compliance and law enforcement needs.

“Bitcoin has this reputation for anonymity but it’s not actually completely anonymous in that every transaction is recoded,” says Smith. “Bitcoin was designed to be a form of censorship-resistant digital cash; anonymity was never the original design goal.”

“There’s a lot of powerful information recorded [in the Bitcoin blockchain] if you go back. This is only seven years old and people’s understanding of it is evolving, and there are some transactions people have made in the past before they realized it wasn’t anonymous,” he adds.

“People will have to be pragmatic about how you treat things that happened four years ago as well. Because if you take some of the exchanges, for example, who are perfectly legitimate businesses because they didn’t have tools like ours available four years ago or two years ago even, they were often getting people… taking money out of the Silk Road and then cashing out on their exchange. And they had no way of identifying that.”

Bitcoin has been through many ups and downs, from peak hype and fluctuating values back in 2013 to something that feels rather more questioned than hyped now. Just as well then that Elliptic has not hitched its wagon to the fortunes of Bitcoin per se, with Smith talking up the potential of the underlying blockchain technology — and envisaging future applications for its technology that don’t involved Bitcoin itself.

“Bitcoin is one of several areas we may end up deploying this technology,” he notes, adding that in fact the analysis can be applied to any ledger of transactions (it does not even need to be a blockchain-powered ledger).

“What it really is is you build up a view of a network. You look at the different entities in a network — that’s a graph of entities — and we’re able to identify patterns within that. Quite complex patterns that connect together different entities in ways that might not be immediately obvious. And that’s what allows us to identify things like money laundering or people trying to obfuscate where their funds are flowing for other reasons.”

One possible blockchain application he sees potential for is settlements of securities — something he notes banks are doing trials with now. Aka deciding, after a trade, when shares are transferred.

“In a domain like that where you’ve got a lot of regular movement around of valuable securities the market supervisor will want to be aware of whether there are any signs of market abuse. And again with securities frauds, people are pretty smart, generally, and there are quite complex patterns of how it’s done. So again it’s an area we can use our ability to understand patterns within a network of entities to highlight things were people might be trying to abuse the system.”

But (for the moment) back to Bitcoin, Smith says that while the digital currency may now be a less easy route to launder money, vs its earlier Wild West years, he remains confident the criminals will keep trying to use Bitcoin — and that, ultimately, is good for Elliptic’s (current) business.

“Every asset is to some extent [used by criminals]. And Bitcoin is a way to move large amounts of money with low cost and low friction so it will always have some attraction. And it will become a bit of an arms race. It already is. The sophistication with which criminals try to hide their tracks within Bitcoin will continue to increase and our ability to uncover that will continue to increase alongside it,” he adds.

“I hope that this will be a catalyst for more legitimate businesses to feel like they are ready to start having a look at this space. And I hope we’ll see a growth in Bitcoin as a result. But we’re very confident that blockchains more broadly are going to become a bigger part of how financial services work over the coming years.”

Elliptic’s $5M Series A round was led by Washington-based Paladin Capital Group, with participation from Santander InnoVentures, KRW Schindler, Digital Currency Group, and existing investor, Octopus Ventures.

Smith says the round will be used to expand the team, with key hires planned for the product and technology side. The funding is also intended to give the company 1.5 years’ worth of runway — which he says he hopes will be enough time to develop applications for the technology outside Bitcoin.

“The reason we have raised to give us a year and a half is we think that’s about the amount of time it’s going to take for other blockchains to start coming online in any sort of production capacity. There’s a lot of trials out there but we think it’s still a way away before banks start using blockchain technology in anger,” he says.

“I don’t think [Bitcoin] is going away… but I’m undecided as to whether it’s going to become huge. In recent years as a society we’ve somewhat been moving away from cash and as much as people’s faith might have been shaken by the credit crisis, everybody relies on credit. And everybody relies on trusting institutions that are bigger than them. So I would like to see Bitcoin become bigger but I’m much more bullish on the technology underneath than I necessarily am on the currency.”",0

Celebrating dance music from the 1940s bandstands through the digital downloads of the 1990s, members of the Kiwanis Club of Burbank gathered to present their 21st annual gala fundraiser at Pickwick Gardens this past Saturday evening.

Prior to the evening’s dinner, entertainment and awards program, local Kiwanians and supporters mingled during a cocktail reception that included an eclectic silent auction that took up an entire room.

Among the local dignitaries out in support of the organization were state Sen. Anthony Portantino, Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, Burbank Vice Mayor Sharon Springer, Councilman Bob Frutos, City Treasurer Debbie Kukta, City Clerk Zizette Mullins, and school board members Roberta Reynolds, Steve Frintner and Charlene Tabet.

Welcomed by Lisa Malm, president of the Kiwanis Club of Burbank, as well as event’s chairwoman Cynthia Faust, and her co-chair Marsha Jackson, attendees enjoyed the evening’s main event hosted by KFI AM 640 radio personality Tim Conway Jr. that honored seven Burbank students.

Four of the evening’s honorees, John Muir Middle School students Michaelangelo Salazar, Lilyan Hawrylo, Madison Clevenger and Andranik Koshkaryan, were lauded for excelling in the school’s speech and public-speaking program, which is sponsored by local Kiwanians.

The program has proved to be such a success in helping young people develop and hone public-speaking skills that it will soon be extended to Luther Burbank Middle School and Jordan Middle School.

The other trio of honorees were singers Elizabeth Mansour, Isabella Ema Meneses and Genesis Ochoa, who were participants in the “Burbank Singing Star” contest. The event is staged annually by the Kiwanis Club and the Music Junction music school.

The Kiwanis Club of Burbank has been in continuous service since its establishment in 1922. Its members provide physical, moral and financial support for dozens of community projects, events, youth groups and fundraisers throughout the year.

An all-volunteer organization, the club is the largest service organization in Burbank. Through their many projects, they strive to teach leadership, good citizenship, self-confidence, a positive work ethic, respect for others and the spirit of service to young people.

Among the many causes and programs local Kiwanians embrace are Key Clubs at five local schools, Burbank High School’s art, music and drama departments, scholarships for local students, teacher recognition programs and the aforementioned speech and music programs.

Along with Malm, Faust and Jackson, last week’s fundraiser was also made possible by the organizations vice presidents, Luis Centeno and Pam Corradi and members Gary Peterson, Thomas Engman, Cathy Hutt, Harvey Branman, David Harris, Charles Chavoor, Jim Gibson, Ron Rothacher, Pat Beuthler, Chris Gargaro, Jackie Jones, Steve Oakley, Hazel Schrefel, Linda Wiggins, Bryan Snodgrass, Kellie Lupe-Smith, Juan Guillen, Nancy Serpa, Diana Cripe, Douglas Chadwick, Caesar Milch, Wally Kendig, Joseph Terranova and Stephen Veresi.",0
160,Robert Abela,"Robert Abela (born 7 December 1977) [1] is a Maltese lawyer and politician, currently serving as the Prime Minister of Malta. A Member of Parliament since 2017, he replaced Joseph Muscat as Leader of the Labour Party following the party's internal leadership election held on 11 January 2020, and was instated as prime minister on 13 January. Abela is the son of George Abela, the eighth president of Malta.

Early life, family and professional career

Born in Sliema in the Northern Harbour District, [2] to George Abela (President of Malta Margaret (née Cauchi), [3] [4] Robert Abela grew up with his sister Marija in Għaxaq and Marsaskala in the south of Malta. Their mother, Margaret, worked in the administration of the Old University in Valletta and later managed the family's law firm. Robert attended the Sisters’ School in Santa Luċija and St Francis primary school in Bormla, to then continue secondary school and sixth form at St Aloysius' College. [5]

A football player in his youth, he played in goal for the national youth team. [5] Abela also practised bodybuilding, competing twice in the national championships in the late 1990s. [6] [7]

Abela studied law at the University of Malta, where he met his future wife Lydia. He graduated in 2002. [8]

Following his graduation, he worked in the family's Abela Advocates law firm, [5] specializing in industrial and labour law. [9] His law firm's contract with Malta's Planning Authority predates Labour's election in 2013 and has been renewed yearly since. Abela has been criticised for benefiting from direct orders for legal services for public entities, [10] including Enemalta and Transport Malta. [11] In 2018, Robert Abela said that no conflict of interest arose from his acting as legal representative of Air Malta while his father, former President George Abela, was the mediator and chief negotiator in talks with its pilots. [12] After 2013, Abela Advocates held a license (IIP 161) for the sale of Maltese citizenship (Individual Investors Programme), in the name of Robert's wife Lydia. [13] The license was dropped in early 2020 once Robert became Prime Minister.

In 2008, he married Lydia Abela (née Zerafa), who later took the role of secretary of the Labour Party executive committee. They have a daughter, Giorgia Mae, born in 2012. [14]

Robert Abela became involved in politics while his father George Abela was deputy party leader, supporting the party in the 1996 general election. [5] He claimed that he started off transporting sick people to the polling stations in 1996, and worked behind the scenes for many years in other roles, such as representing the party on current affairs programmes as requested by Joseph Muscat and lately as his legal advisor in Cabinet. [14] He also supported his father in the failed Labour leadership bid against Joseph Muscat in 2008, after Alfred Sant 's resignation. [5]

On 25 January 2017, Abela highlighted that a patch of land in his native Qormi was seriously undervalued during the previous Partit Nazzjonalista administration, where contractors paid €0.9 million instead of the full value of €8 million. [15]

Abela was described as appealing to voters with no political ties, as well as the perfect replacement to attract Marie Louise Coleiro Preca 's votes in the sixth district of Siggiewi, Luqa and Qormi. He had already been approached; however, he chose his legal profession over politics. [16]

Member of the Parliament of Malta[ edit ]

In June 2017, at the age of 40, he was elected to the Parliament of Malta after his first attempt at contesting the sixth district, including Siggiewi, Luqa and Qormi, was successful. [17] He also served as legal adviser to the Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, [5] which enabled him to attend the meetings of the Council of Ministers. [9] The Opposition claimed that his private consultancy contracts with the Planning Authority and Transport Malta earned him at least €580,000. [11]

In October 2019 Abela stated that more Police are needed on Malta's streets to tackle residents' migration-related concerns. [18]

In his years at the Parliament, Abela was never an outspoken critic of Muscat; in the fallout of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder, he remarked that he would have ""acted earlier"" to remove minister Konrad Mizzi and chief of staff Keith Schembri from their posts if he were leader. [14]

2020 Labour leadership race[ edit ]

Following the announcement of Joseph Muscat 's upcoming resignation due to the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and the ensuing protests, deputy prime minister Chris Fearne was considered the front-runner to replace Muscat as leader of the party and Prime Minister, and other hopefuls (including Ian Borg and Miriam Dalli) were reportedly pressured not to run in order to allow a quick transition by Christmas 2019 with the formality of a vote by party members for a single candidate. [14] Robert Abela remarked that he did not want to be a part of any ""diabolical pact"", and presented his candidacy as an alternative to Chris Fearne. [19] [20] [21] However, according to James Debono, Abela was soon recognised as the ""continuity"" candidate instead of Fearne, emphasizing stability, unity and normality, as opposed to the bolder changes advocated by Fearne. [22]

Abela's leadership campaign was focused on party members and aimed at striking a chord with the traditional Labour themes (social housing, free medicines for the elderly and better employment conditions for blue-collar workers) [9] [23] while distancing himself from the coziness of Muscat with big business. [14] He also called for a crack-down on cheap labour migrant workers, who he accused of repressing local salaries, by proposing that employers be allowed to hire foreigners only if able to pay them fully on the books and while respecting work condition regulations. [24] He also guaranteed the continuation of Malta's controversial citizenship-by-investment programme. [23]

Abela, a backbencher with no ministerial experience, presented himself as a candidate of continuity, pledging to maintain the same cabinet as Muscat's, as well as the same staff at the powerful Office of the Prime Minister, in opposition to Chris Fearne, whose campaign for a clean slate at Castille created apprehension among insiders. [14]

Abela was openly critical of the 2019 Malta political crisis surrounding the Daphne Caruana Galizia carbombing. [25] In fact, on 28 November 2019, he claimed that the Labour Party would need deep rooted changes rather than superficial ones. [26] Abela also claimed that the only purpose of the 2019 Maltese protests was provocation. [27]

Abela also stated that his family law firm — headed by his wife — should retain the right to bid for public tenders, should he take up office. [10] Following controversies, [28] he later backtracked and committed not to seek public contracts for his family law firm. [12]

His campaign was criticised for not accepting any interviews from the independent press, but only relying on Labour-friendly media outlets. [29]

At the internal party elections on 12 January 2020, Abela obtained 9,342 votes against 6,798 for Chris Fearne. Over 92% of MLP members cast their vote in party clubs across the country. [14] Abela was thus proclaimed new leader of the Labour Party.

The following day Joseph Muscat resigned from the post of Prime Minister. President George Vella accepted Muscat's resignation and appointed Abela as new Prime Minister of Malta. [30] His first official appointment was that of Clyde Caruana as his Head of Secretariat. [31] [32]",0
385,Digital Signal Raises $15M For 'Minority Report'-Type Facial Recognition Tech,"I trust you’ve seen Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise. Now check out the website of Digital Signal Corporation (shots below of the homepage and a scene from the movie). The company looks like it could have delivered the biometric facial recognition technology showcased in the film, doesn’t it?

Haven’t seen the movie? Then try and imagine visiting the Digital Signal website and reading its lofty mission statement (“we make the world safer by delivering the only precision long range three dimensional identity solution capable of recognizing people on the move”) in the year 2002, when Minority Report was released. You would consider it to be some sort of prank, I wager – I know I’d at least have considered the possibility of it being a joke back then.

Before I digress too much: Digital Signal Corporation is real – and it was founded in 2001. They’ve just raised $15 million in Series C financing in a round from Columbia Capital, City Light Capital, SilverHaze Partners, Novak Biddle Venture Partners and Paladin Capital Group.

The company’s 3D facial recognition technology helps commercial and government customers identify and monitor moving “non cooperative subjects” at long range.

Digital Signal’s biometric system is primarily used to detect criminal and or terrorist activity, the company posits, although its solutions can also be used to identify important customers, friendly soldiers, or frequent travelers.

Says David Guttadauro, CEO of Digital Signal:

“In an increasingly uncertain world, leaders in the security industry are constantly seeking the most effective, state-of-the-art systems to support their objectives, whether it be clearly identifying known terrorists at an airport or tracking down a repeat shoplifter or member of an organized crime family.”

Amazing, if slightly unnerving indeed.",0
433,Liability of legal persons and foreign bribery laws needed to fight corruption in Southeast Asia,"Legal persons dominate today’s global economy. Large multinationals engaged in transportation, construction, telecommunication, mining, energy, chemicals, and many other sectors have a huge share of global business activities. This puts them at risk of getting involved in high-level corruption cases.

Perhaps not surprisingly, many of the biggest corruption investigations today concern legal persons rather than natural persons. For example, China fined GlaxoSmithKline, the UK’s biggest pharmaceutical firm, $490 million after finding it guilty of bribery. The U.S. Department of Justice imposed nearly $220 million in fines on Japanese company JGC for bribing Nigerian officials to secure development contracts for liquefied natural gas facilities. More recently, government agents raided the headquarters of Lotte group¬-among the largest conglomerates in South Korea-as part of a corruption probe. One of the highest fines ever imposed occurred to Alstom S.A., a French power and transportation company, sentenced to $772,29 million. Overall, Alstom paid more than $75 million in secret bribes to government officials in several countries, such as Indonesia and Taiwan.

Criminal prosecution has an important deterrent effect on corruption. However, punishing only natural persons in cases that directly involve corporations might not be enough. We need to establish clearly the liability of legal persons for corruption offences in order to deter corporations willing to break the rules. This is easier said than done. Many countries today remain reluctant to impose criminal liability on legal persons because of a strict adherence to the traditional maxim that requires moral culpability for the commission of criminal offences.

Article 26 of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) establishes the liability of legal persons as a mandatory provision. At the end of 2015, ten of the eleven countries in the Southeast Asian region had completed or were concluding their first cycle review (Chapter III and IV) of the UNCAC, which included Article 26. The review found that most Southeast Asian countries do not sufficiently cover the requirements of UNCAC Article 26. Even in countries where the appropriate legislation is in place, there have been only few prosecutions and convictions of legal persons for corruption offences.

In addition, eight of the ten Southeast Asian countries that have completed their first cycle review do not have specific legislation explicitly addressing the issue of active bribery of foreign public officials and officials of public international organizations, as required by UNCAC Article 16, Paragraph 1. Foreign bribery is an act involving a foreign national providing or offering a benefit to another person from a different country, or causing a benefit to be provided or offered to another person from a different country, where the benefit is not legitimately due. This issue is very relevant given the high degree of economic development and integration among the countries in the region.

To support ongoing anti-corruption reform efforts in the region, the Regional Office for Southeast Asia and Pacific (ROSEAP) will organise a Regional Workshop on Liability of Legal Persons for Corruption Offences at the National and International Level, in Bangkok, Thailand, on 16-17 August 2016. The workshop will bring together about 50 policymakers and practitioners from across Southeast Asia and beyond. The goal is to raise awareness on these topics among public officials from the region and strengthen legislative and implementation capacities of the national authorities in ASEAN with regard to Art 16 and 26 of the UNCAC.",0
131,US pushes $2.9bn armed drones sale to UAE: Sources,"The United States’s State Department has given Congress notification it plans to sell 18 sophisticated armed MQ-9B aerial drones to the United Arab Emirates in a deal worth as much as $2.9bn, people briefed on the matter have told the Reuters news agency.

The move came on the heels of last week’s notification of a potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to the oil-rich Gulf state and one of Washington’s closest Middle East allies.

The sale would mark the first armed drone export since the Trump administration reinterpreted a Cold War-era arms agreement between 34 nations to allow US defence contractors to sell more drones to allies.

Reuters reported the UAE has long shown interest in buying drones from the US and would be among the first customers in line after US export policy changed this summer.

A $600m deal to sell four unarmed but weapons-ready MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones to Taiwan was the first to be formally announced to Congress on Tuesday.

This informal notice for the Reaper-style drones is the precursor to the State Department’s formal and public notification.

The US Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees – whose members have criticised the UAE’s role in civilian deaths in Yemen’s civil war – have the ability to review and block weapons sales under an informal review process before the State Department sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.

The US State Department may wait to formally notify Congress of the sale once staff and members are briefed on the potential sale, one of the people said. The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales.

“As a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress,” a US State Department spokesman told Reuters.

The armed MQ-9B drones will also be equipped with maritime radar and could be delivered in 2024. The package notified to Congress is for 15 with an option for three additional drones, one of the people said.

The UAE is also seeking a package of Boeing Co EA-18G Growlers, an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft, that are capable of jamming radar and other advanced capabilities. Growlers are operated by the US and Australia.

The UAE has long expressed interest in acquiring the stealthy F-35 jets and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal made when they agreed to normalise relations with Israel. The informal notification for 50 Lockheed Martin Co F-35 jets was made on October 29.

But any deal the US makes to sell weapons in the region must satisfy decades of agreement with Israel where the US-made weapon must not impair Israel’s “qualitative military edge”, guaranteeing US weapons furnished to Israel are “superior in capability” to those sold to its neighbours.",0
411,Greece begs British pensioners to retire there offering cut price taxes to would-be expats,"GREECE is begging British pensioners to retire in the sunny paradise by offering cut price taxes to would-be expats.

The Mediterranean country is looking to boost its economic recovery by offering a flat rate of income tax at 7 per cent for foreign retirees willing to transfer their tax residence.

The initiative has been laid out in a draft law and will be tabled later this week in the country's parliament.

The proposed 7 per cent flat rate will apply to all forms of income including rents, dividends or pension, according to the Prime Minister's chief economic adviser Alex Patelis.

Athina Kalyva, the Greek head of tax policy at the finance ministry, told The Observer: ""The logic is very simple: we want pensioners to relocate here.

""We have a beautiful country, a very good climate, so why not?”

But there are conditions attached, and to be eligible you will have to hail from a country with a double taxation treaty with Athens and agree to live in Greece for more than six months.

ECONOMIC BOOST

It comes amidst fears of a new economic meltdown in the country, with forecasts suggesting the economy will contract by 9%.

The country's economy has already been hit badly by austerity measures brought about in the wake of the Eurozone crisis in 2009.

Some 500,000 Greeks have left the country following years of spiralling debt levels and the highest unemployment rate in Europe.

At the height of the financial crisis, Portugal set out similar laws in a bid to lure pensioners to the sunny Algarve - promising a decade of tax-free pensions.

But other EU states lashed out at the proposals, accusing Lisbon of running a discriminatory tax regime.

Greece has also been praised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, seeing a lower death toll than many countries in Europe.

In total, the country has confirmed 194 deaths while the total number of cases stands at 4,007.

However, concern has also been raised that the population isn't following many restrictions.

On Saturday, the government made the wearing of face coverings compulsory to supermarket customers and are considering expanding the rule to public spaces.

And today, the government introduced stricter rules for foreign seasonal workers after a recent spike in cases in the Balkans.",0
21,Charles Murphy (hedge fund manager),"Charles W. Murphy (April 5, 1961 – March 27, 2017) was an American investor and hedge fund manager and has been referred to in media reports as a ""financial guru"". [1]

Early life and education[ edit ]

Charles W. Murphy was born on July 5, 1961 to a middle-class New York family. [2] He grew up in New York City and attended The Buckley School and Stuyvesant High School. He graduated with a B.A. from Columbia University, where he was a member of the starting varsity crew team, earned a law degree from Harvard University, and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [3] [4]

Murphy began his career at Goldman Sachs (1985–1990) then joined Morgan Stanley as a managing director in the Financial Institutions Group (1990–2000). After ten years at Morgan Stanley he moved to London where he led the Financial Institutions Group at Deutsche Bank (2001–2005) and then at Credit Suisse (2005–2007). [4]

Murphy also worked at Fairfield Greenwich, which had invested more than $7 billion in the notorious Madoff Ponzi scheme. [5] Murphy was unaware the firm was being victimized by Madoff. Murphy joined investment firm Paulson & Co. in 2009. He rose to the level of Partner. While there, he led many successful investments, including help organize the firm's activist push to break up American International Group. [6]

Murphy owned a 19th-century, 11,550-square-foot home in New York that he purchased in 2007 for $33 million, a record price at the time, from Seagram heir Matthew Bronfman. [7] In 2016, Murphy listed the property for sale for $49.5 million. In April 2018 Murphy's widow, Annabella Murphy, sold the seven story home for $28.5 million. [5]

At the time of his death, Murphy was married to his second wife Annabella Murphy and had four children. [1]

Death[ edit ]

Murphy died on Monday March 28, 2017 at the age of 56 after falling, dressed in a suit, [7] from the 24th floor of the Sofitel Hotel in midtown Manhattan. [6] Three weeks before his death, Murphy added his wife, Annabella to the deed of their home, giving her sole ownership of the property, which suggests Murphy may have planned his death in advance. [7]

Murphy was being treated for depression by a psychiatrist and was taking anti-depressants at the time of his death. [2]",0
641,Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah,"Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah (Arabic: نواف الأحمد الجابر الصباح‎ Nawwāf al-ʾAḥmad al-Jābir aṣ-Ṣabāḥ; born 25 June 1937) is the current Emir of Kuwait and the Commander of the Kuwait Military Forces. On 30 September 2020, he succeeded to the throne following the death of his half-brother, Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. Nawaf had been nominated as Crown Prince on 7 February 2006.

Early life and education[ edit ]

Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was born on 25 June 1937. [1] He is a son of the 10th ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. [2] He studied in different schools in Kuwait. [3]

Sheikh Nawaf is one of the most senior serving members of the House of Sabah and has been serving Kuwait for well over 58 years in various responsibilities. At age 25, he was appointed as governor of Hawalli on 21 February 1962 and held the post until 19 March 1978. [4] In 1978, he assumed the post of Minister of Interior [5] [6] and held this post until 26 January 1988 when he was appointed Minister of Defense. [6] [7] Following the liberation of Kuwait in the Gulf War, Sheikh Nawaf was appointed as the acting minister of labor and social affairs on 20 April 1991 and held the post until 17 October 1992. [6]

On 16 October 1994, Sheikh Nawaf was appointed as deputy chief of the Kuwait National Guard and held that post until 2003. [6] [8] [9] [10] The same year, Sheikh Nawaf reassumed the post of minister of the interior until an Amiri Decree was issued on 16 October 2003 assigning him as first Deputy Prime Minister of Kuwait [11] and Minister of Interior. [5] [6] Sheikh Nawaf played a vital role in supporting programs that support national unity amongst the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and Arab countries. [12]

With the ascendance of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to the leadership of Kuwait on 29 January 2006, an Amiri Decree was issued on 7 February 2006 officially designating Sheikh Nawaf as the Crown Prince. [6] This was contrary to the tradition of the Al-Sabah family, according to which the offices of Emir and Crown Prince are supposed to alternate between the Al-Jaber and Al-Salem branches. [13] [14]

Sheikh Sabah died on 29 September 2020 and Nawaf was announced as the Emir of Kuwait during a meeting of the National Assembly. [15] [16] [17]

331,France marks five years since Paris attacks with silent ceremonies,"France has marked five years to the day since terrorists carried out a series of coordinated terrorist attacks across Paris, killing 130 people.

The prime minister, Jean Castex, and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, carried out a series of silent ceremonies at each of the sites where the gunmen and suicide bombers loyal to Islamic State struck on 13 November 2015.

It was France’s worst peacetime attack and led to a wave of international sympathy for the traumatised nation.

On Friday, Castex and Hidalgo laid wreaths at the seven sites where the terrorists struck. The ceremonies were brief and relatively discreet. This year the public had been advised to remain at home under the Covid-19 lockdown rules, but several people turned out anyway to place flowers and cards in memory of the victims.

Friday’s commemorations came as France remained on high alert after three recent attacks by Islamist extremists, including the beheading of high-school teacher Samuel Paty and the killing of three people in a church in Nice.

In 2015, the first attack happened at 9.15pm on Friday 13 November outside the Stade de France during an international football match. Shortly afterwards, another group of heavily armed terrorists drove around the capital’s trendy districts north of the Seine shooting at crowded bars, cafés and restaurants.

Another group stormed the Bataclan during a concert attended by 1,500 people, taking members of the audience hostage and killing 90 people.

Ten months earlier, in January 2015, terrorists had killed 12 people in an attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo after it published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad considered offensive to Muslims. In the following two days, five more people were killed by a terrorist gunman, including four people at a Jewish supermarket.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has recently come under fierce criticism for proposing a new law on “Islamist separatism”. The Élysée says the legislation –to be presented to the Assemblée Nationale at the beginning of next month – is aimed at strengthening the country’s secular traditions and preventing the radicalisation of future terrorists. Critics have accused the president and government of targeting the wider Muslim community.

After Paty’s killing, police raided the homes of individuals and offices of a number of Muslim organisations that had no link to the murder in order to “send a message”, according to interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, who also announced the Collective Against Islamophobia in France was being disbanded.

As protests against Macron erupted in many Islamic countries, including Bangladesh and Iran, along with threats to boycott French goods, Darmanin provoked further outrage by questioning why supermarkets had specific halal and kosher food sections.

On Friday, Franck Riester, a delegate minister in charge of foreign trade and economic attractiveness, told foreign journalists this comment was Darmanin’s “personal” view. He insisted the government was not targeting French Muslims and hit back at criticism of its response to the terrorist attacks.

“France is under attack and as we have seen so is Austria and some Islamic countries, so this is a common fight against terrorism,” Riester said.

“We will continue to defend its citizens and those on its soil and defend our values and will not be influenced or pressured by anyone. I absolutely don’t accept the position of those who say this (terrorism) is France’s fault or the fruit of its politics and choices. That’s the world turned upside down.”",0

243,PumaPay is paving the way for mass crypto adoption,"PumaPay is one of the most innovative providers of a fully decentralized blockchain-based payment system. Since their establishment, the company has maintained that its vision is to be one of the frontrunners in supporting mass crypto adoption. To date, PumaPay continues to refine their technology, adding new features that are slowly helping their vision come to fruition. The latest developments are no different.

With their new hybrid solution, PumaPay differentiates itself from other payment service providers. Combining crypto with traditional finance, their service now enables payments to be made and received in any currency, with the PMA token acting as a means of value transfer, by virtually anyone from merchants of all varieties to end-users. With measures in place to ensure zero exposure to volatility for all parties and easy onboarding and offboarding to crypto the PumaPay solution offers maximum utility to all.

PumaPay CEO, Yoav Dror, said: “By providing innovative and much-needed developments ready to be utilized in the emerging crypto space, we bring the community one step closer to mass crypto adoption. As of today, we have managed to close the loop and offer a fully comprehensive, blockchain-based payment solution that mitigates widespread concerns regarding accessibility, regulation, volatility and usability.”

With that in mind, let’s review some of PumaPay’s groundbreaking contributions:

· The heart of their PullPayment Protocol; a variety of customizable billing models, such as their innovative Recurring and Auto-Up Schemes. Utilizing smart contract architecture, these billing models were designed to offer maximum utility to businesses in their daily transactions.

· A fully decentralized, native app: the PumaPay Cryptocurrency mobile wallet. Available for Android and iOS devices, the app enables the sending, receiving, and storing of main cryptocurrencies, such as: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), as well as all other ERC-20 tokens.

· Streamlined, in-app cryptocurrency exchange services that allow for easy conversion from other cryptocurrencies to PMA.

· Encouraged merchant-customer trust via easily accessible, in-app refund requests.

· Fully compliant user onboarding that adheres to the 5 th Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the KYC verification process. PumaPay has also gone as far as to ensure that their solution is compliant with current AML laws but is also future proof for future developments in the field.

· A comprehensive payment gateway, the PumaPay Business console. This platform empowers merchants with the ability to accept crypto, set up customized billings models, as well as manage and optimize their payment flow.

· Zero exposure to crypto volatility and guaranteed full liquidity with the PumaPay Fiat Settlement Layer. With this service, the currency rate is “locked,” thereby eliminating volatility risks and enabling offboarding from crypto to fiat. Further, merchants also have a straightforward means to withdraw funds and directly transfer into their bank account.

· In-app banner placement that provides clear, uninterrupted communication channels between merchants and their respective customers.

· A comprehensive PSP API solution that supports seamless integration for PSPs and their merchants/businesses looking to accept crypto as a means of payment. These advanced tools also aid in easing the onboarding process for clients whilst also providing PSPs with access to all features of the PumaPay PullPayment Protocol.

· Full certification by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) and Data Security Standards (DSS). This has and continues to ensure that PumaPay adheres to the highest safety standards and application of anti-fraud prevention measures. In complying with global data security standards, they keep their users’ data safe and secure.

· Easy integration with a fully documented API.

· An open-source developer hub space completed with all necessary documentation, product library and guides available at Wiki PumaPay.

· Finally, PumaPay’s most recent development, the “B uy Crypto ” service, enables PumaPay wallet users to purchase cryptocurrencies within the app with a credit/debit card. Combined with the ability to exchange crypto to PMA from within the wallet, and the Fiat Settlement Layer, PumaPay is ‘ closing the loop ’ and creating a complete payment system that is connected to the traditional financial system at its endpoints, allowing easy onboarding and offboarding. In the coming weeks, they will improve the process even further, allowing direct purchase of PMA tokens with credit card from within the wallet.

Going forward, PumaPay has already started to provide some insight into their blueprint for mass crypto adoption. A snapshot of some of the projects they are currently looking into includes:

· The introduction of their very own Side Chain which will provide users with an improved, more competitive service, by expediting transaction settlement times and lowering GAS fees.

· US token – a new project that will hopefully allow PumaPay to offer l tokens to US-based clients, whilst fully complying with US Government regulation.

· Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – a staking mechanism that will offer PMA token holders with the ability to earn money for their holdings.

In paving the way towards mass crypto adoption, PumaPay is maintaining their momentum by consistently providing their users with cost-effective, simple, and efficient means to manage and process their payments. From their billing models to the PumaPay crypto wallet, their services are designed for maximum utility by anyone; whether you be a user wanting to purchase services with crypto or a merchant looking to engage customers and maximize your revenue!",0
173,Algeria: Abdelmadjid Tebboune soon forced to call on IMF?,"With the downturn, accelerated by the fall in the price of oil and the health crisis, Algeria seems ever closer to financial crisis.

Serious enough for the country to be forced to resort to external debt before it is too late.

Despite Algiers’ first painful experience with the multilateral lender in the midst of the civil war, there are new signals that suggest the country may now be interested in IMF support.

The first signal was the appointment by President Tebboune, at the end of September, of Rosthom Fadli as new central bank governor.

Sovereignty first

The governor of the Bank of Algeria is not empowered to make decisions regarding the possible use of external credit: the decision is the responsibility of the President of the Republic.

A path that Abdelmadjid Tebboune has always refused to take “for the sake of preserving national sovereignty. A concern shared by all Algerians,” says Bader Eddine Nouioua, former governor of the Central Bank (1985-1989).

The Algerian president nevertheless chose to appoint a more open-minded technocrat from its ranks. Fadli spent most of his career at the Bank of Algeria in the Directorate of External Financial Relations, before becoming its vice-governor.

IMF “Committed to help Algeria”

Another sign is the IMF’s increasingly regular statements about Algeria, even if the country is the only one in the region not to have had recourse to the Fund’s financial support in the fight against the consequences of Covid-19.

Algeria’s worsening economic situation, however, has not left the radar of the Bretton Woods institution.

Moreover, according to Geneviève Verdier, IMF Head of Mission for Algeria, “the IMF remains committed to helping Algeria cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Remote missions on capacity building have taken place, and the country team has worked with the authorities to obtain strategic advice.”

At the end of April, the international institution sounded the alarm. The Fund estimated the price of a barrel of oil required for the Algerian budget to be balanced in 2020 at $157.2 in its “Regional Economic Outlook – Middle East and Central Asia”, which also covers North Africa.

The IMF also says this level of budget balance for Algeria would have required an impossible $100/barrel on average over the last three years (2017-2019).

A budget unbalanced by oil

This equilibrium price for 2020 is one of the highest in the world, after that for Iran ($389/b) and before that for Bahrain ($96/b). At present, the current price of Brent crude does not exceed $42-43 per barrel.

“This illustrates once again the very strong dependence of the Algerian economy on the price of hydrocarbons, especially the price of oil. This situation has been well known for many years, but it is even more true in this very difficult year of 2020,” says Francis Perrin, research director at Iris (Paris) and associate researcher at the Policy Center for the New South in Rabat.

In addition, the IMF also calculates the level of oil prices to ensure that the current account balance is balanced. For Algeria, it is $112 per barrel for 2020. This is the highest level among oil-producing countries covered by the IMF outlook.

“Whether we are talking about internal (budget) or external (balance of payments) economic balances, Algeria needs a very high oil price,” adds Francis Perrin.

Local media have hammered this home in recent weeks to emphasize the depth of the economic crisis that the country is going through. One more worrying anomaly: the Central Bank has stopped producing monthly statistics since December 2019.

“With such estimates, the IMF is increasing the pressure on the Algerian government to find sources of revenue outside oil,” says an analyst specializing in Algerian economic policy.

Low external debt…

On October 15, the IMF brought out the heavy guns to highlight the urgency of the Algerian economic situation. In an economic outlook note, the international institution forecasts a historic drop in GDP to -5.5% in 2020, before a slight recovery of 3.2% in 2021.

“Prior to the pandemic, credit growth in Algeria had been rapid, the monetization of the deficit had increased macroeconomic risks, and international reserves had declined significantly. Government interventions in the economy are pervasive and financed by hydrocarbon revenues, making Algeria highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks and leaving it with limited room for maneuver to absorb them,” the Fund notes.

“I think now is the time to go to the IMF, or turn to international donors such as the African Development Bank (ADB) or the World Bank,” said Algerian economist Ali Harbi, at a conference organized October 18 by Algeria in motion, a program of the Forum France-Algeria 2018.

“As long as we still have a small mattress and that we have enough to negotiate, it’s time,” he said. Indeed, the country has a relatively low external debt, at 1.7% of GDP in 2019, according to French Treasury figures.

Former Bank of Algeria Governor Bader Nouioua also points out: “At present, Algeria has a very low external debt and can obtain sufficient credit from the multilateral financial institutions of which it is a member, if it presents them with reliable and well-considered projects without compromising its sovereignty and independence. This is an important issue, and it is regrettable that the country has been slow to decide to resort to external financing, in complete freedom, to undertake its development before it is forced to do so under difficult conditions, under pressure from the IMF.”

…but an acute pressure on the balance of payments

Apart from the external debt, considered “good debt” by economists, other indicators that measure the balance of payments debt, and therefore the risk of deficit of the country, have gone into the red.

According to data compiled by international institutions, by the end of 2020, Algeria should have just under $45bn in foreign exchange reserves, compared to $61bn at the end of 2019. And IMF projections for end 2021 anticipate a level of less than $22bn dollars.

In addition, Algeria’s fiscal and current account deficits are projected to reach -20% and -18% of GDP, respectively, by 2020; and its domestic public debt ratio is projected to be close to 46% of GDP in 2019 – five times higher than in 2014 – and to rise to more than 53% by the end of the year.

“At this rate, the reserves needed to pay for the imports the country needs will be exhausted by early 2022,” said an Algerian economic policy specialist contacted by JA.

Budgetary deadlock

“All of this puts the government in a budgetary deadlock, since the public debt affects the dinar, and President Tebboune has prohibited himself from printing money,” continued our interlocutor.

“But without creating money, how can we act to increase government revenues? With a low oil price, insufficient tax collection since the economy is almost at a standstill because of the Covid-19 …”.

As for the dinar, after an accelerated fall since February, it is at its lowest level against the euro in ten years.

When 1 euro was still trading at nearly 134 dinars at the end of 2019, it has reached more than 150 dinars today. And the economist concludes: “The IMF becomes unavoidable, because banks will lend only if the Fund is in control.”

In other words, by procrastinating as it is doing, while its foreign exchange reserves remain high but are under pressure (from the trade deficit and weakened dinar), the Algerian government risks aggravating a fragile situation… And being forced to turn in extremis to the IMF, which would this time be in a position of strength to set terms.",0
610,Go backs anti-money laundering measures,"SENATOR Christopher “Bong” Go has expressed his support for proposed measures that aim to strengthen anti-money laundering efforts in the Philippines in compliance with the legal standards set by concerned international bodies.

During a Senate Committee on Banks, Financial Institutions and Currencies hearing on Wednesday, October 28, Go echoed the calls of President Rodrigo Duterte and Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III to strengthen efforts against money laundering in the country through the proposed Senate Bill 1412 and its counterpart House Bill 6174.

Go noted that Duterte has certified the proposed measure as urgent.

“ I echo the President’s call to comply with legal standards for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing, as established by relevant international bodies, ” Go said during the hearing.

The proposed measures seek to strengthen Republic Act 9160 or the “ Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001 ”, making the country compliant with the legal standards set by international bodies in addressing money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities.

Go cited that just last March, the Bureau of Customs confirmed that $370 million in dirty money entered the country. According to the DOF, two groups allegedly laundered around $167.97 million and $200.24 million, respectively.

In response, Dominguez ordered the BOC to work with the Anti-Money Laundering Council in investigating the entry into the country of dirty money.

In the hearing, Go also expressed his support for the inclusion of tax crimes and violation of the Strategic Trade and Management Act, which indirectly includes proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as predicate to money laundering.

Moreover, Go said that the swift passage of the measure will also benefit overseas Filipino workers.

“ Possible na sila po ang direktang maapektuhan dahil kapag hindi po na-amend ang ating Anti-Money Laundering Law, maaari pong ma grey list ang Pilipinas ng Financial Action Task Force at tumaas ang cost ng remittance rates para sa ating mga OFWs, ” he said.

“ Nararapat lamang po na maglaan tayo ng sapat na proteksyon upang mapangalagaan ang kapakanan ng ating mga kababayan. Our campaign has always been against criminality and corruption aside from the war on illegal drugs, ” he added.

Ending his statement, Go emphasized that strengthening laws against money laundering will boost the government’s fight against criminality.

“ Our campaign has always been against criminality and corruption aside from the war on illegal drugs. Amidst the continuing pandemic that has hampered, not just the economy but also the lives of our brothers and sisters, criminality and corruption have become more important issues that we must take seriously, ” said Go.

“ At the time when our people are experiencing unprecedented hardships, every single centavo counts. Make no mistake, tutuluyan talaga namin ni Presidente ang mga manloloko at magnanakaw, ” he added.",0
598,Who’s Who: Prime Minister Hussein Arnous,"In Brief

Many Syrians were surprised when Bashar al-Assad appointed Hussein Arnous as prime minister after the dismissal of Imad Khamis, in what resembled a scandal, on Aug. 30, 2020. The Syrians knew nothing about Arnous, despite him being part of the Syrian bureaucratic system for nearly thirty years. People close to him say that he lacks personality and is unable to take decisions.

Background

Hussein Arnous was born in al-Teh village, Maarat al-Nu’man, in the Idleb countryside, in 1953. He graduated from the Faculty of Civil Engineering at University of Aleppo in 1978.

He has a long history of political work with the Assad regimes of both Hafez and Bashar, and has assumed leadership positions in Assad institutions since the ‘80s. Arnous held several positions in the government of the Syrian regime, starting with heading the Idleb branch of the Syrian Engineers Syndicate between (1989-1994), then taking over the management of the General Company for Roads and Bridges (1992-2002).

In 2004, Arnous was appointed Director General of the General Organization for Road Transport, until 2009.

Bashar al-Assad appointed him Governor of Deir ez-Zor in 2009, a position he kept until 2011, when he was appointed Governor of Quneitra, until 2013.

He assumed the position of Minister of Public Works and Housing on Feb. 9, 2013, and was re-selected by the government of Wael al-Halqi in 2014, and again by the government of Imad Khamis, in 2016.

Syrian Revolution

Hussein Arnous was not known to have participated directly in the suppression of the Syrian revolution, but some believe he is flirting with the pro-Iran leaders of the Shiite community, to please Iran and of having close ties to Tehran. He was the first prime minister from the Idleb during the era of the two Assads, father and son.

Arnous’ absolute and continuous support for Bashar al-Assad and the narrow circle around him played a role in enhancing Assad’s ability to kill more Syrians. That is why Arnous was affected by the US and European sanctions imposed on the regime’s ministers in 2014, in addition to a travel ban imposed on him.

Role in the Syrian Government

If you examine the track record of Hussein Arnous, will not stumble upon any achievement, in any of the positions he held from 1989 until today.

However, what is remarkable in Arnous’ biography, is the large number of positions, which he started assuming early on in his life — eight positions in 30 years, half or more of which he spent in public institutions related to roads. He graduated from Director of the General Company for Roads and Bridges (1992-2002) to Assistant to the Minister of Transportation (2002-2004), and finally Director General of the Public Establishment of Roads Communications (2004-2009).

Even when he took over the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (2013-2018), he did not break out of the roads, sidewalks, and bridges bubble. Arnous used to work in a high-stakes sector, but we must not overlook that the latter was controlled by big contractors such as Dhu al-Himma Shalish, Riad Issa Shalish, Tamim Badr, and other corrupt people under the rule of Hafez and Bashar al-Assad, who, through Arnous, made handsome amounts of money, as well as the money they stole from the Syrian people and the treasury.

Some Syrian analysts point to who the godfathers of Arnous were, and who kept him in positions of power without interruption from 1989 until today, a privilege that none of the current faces in the regime enjoyed, including those in military leadership positions. The analysts add that Arnous was a tool that the corrupt used for thirty years, through which they were able to steal the country’s resources, while he remained untouchable.

Arnous played a major role in sowing corruption in the Establishment of Roads Communications, and when a journalist requested information from the Ministry of Transport, the head of the minister’s press office warned him against pursuing the issue.

Therefore, few people have insight into the corruption of the sector or the amount of money that was stolen, which economists estimate to be tens of billions of Syrian pounds preceding 2011, most of which was pocketed by Dhul-Himma Shalish and Riad Shalish, who were also stealing raw materials from the army, executing government projects in a mediocre way, and charging huge sums for their services.

The same analysts believe that the secret behind Arnous’ continuous rise to the top is his ability to keep the secrets of the corrupt, and most importantly, the fact that he is not greedy, for he is satisfied with very little, which could be merely a position, according to those close to him.",0
565,"Walmart to sell operations in recession-hit Argentina, taking $1 billion hit","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Walmart Inc, the world’s largest retailer, said on Friday it was selling its retail operations in Argentina to South American supermarket chain owner Grupo de Narváez, pulling back as the country grapples with an economic crisis.

The U.S. company did not disclose the size of the deal for retail operations involving more than 90 stores, but said it would record about a $1 billion after-tax, non-cash loss related to the divestiture in its fiscal third quarter next year.

The sale comes as Argentina, mired in recession since 2018, has just emerged from a sovereign default and is grappling with a currency crisis. The government has been fending off talk that international firms are looking for the exit.

“In Argentina you see a phenomenon of firms divesting, and companies changing hands, reflecting a lack of confidence in the direction of the country,” said Guido Lorenzo, economist at consultancy LCG, adding there was huge uncertainty over policy.

“Argentina lacks clear rules of the game.”

Walmart sold the majority of its unit in Brazil in 2018, though it maintains major operations in Chile and Mexico. The exit from its business in Argentina, where it began operating in 1995 and currently has some 9,000 employees in 92 stores, would include its popular Changomas and Punto Mayorista chains.

Banorte analyst Valentin Mendoza said Walmart’s exit from Argentina indicated it was doubling down on operations where it was already a market leader in Latin America such as Mexico, where it could leverage its dominant position better.

“MYTH OF AN EXODUS”

Argentina is headed for an economic decline of nearly 12% this year, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.

The country has imposed capital controls as it battles a currency crisis, and recently restructured over $100 billion of foreign currency debt with local and international creditors.

The economic malaise and uncertainty have hit corporations in the country and led to others pulling back, including LATAM Airlines Group and department store owner Falabella.

The government has sought to downplay the narrative that international firms are ditching the country over what critics have described as anti-investment policies, and say plans to revive growth will attract funds once again.

""Although the global and local scenario is complex, and despite the myth of an 'exodus', the truth is there are firms continuing to bet on the country and announce investments every week,"" the ministry of development said in a report here this month.

Thomaz Favaro, a regional director at consultancy Control Risks, said firms were concerned about Argentina’s public finances along with a “wide range” of political risks including capital controls, export taxes and expropriations.

“We advise companies in investments across emerging markets and declining interest in Argentina over the past two years is notable,” he said.

Following the acquisition, family-owned Grupo de Narváez will own 656 stores, including supermarkets, and apparel and home appliance outlets in nine countries, including Ecuador and Uruguay, and employ more than 24,500 workers.",0
523,Mystery man behind merger,"Dealers know Bob Brockman as a tough, opinionated, hard-nosed businessman who delivers terrific dealership management software.

For years, the 65-year-old Texan stayed under the radar as boss of little Universal Computer Systems, the Houston company he started 36 years ago in his living room.

Brockman, a shy tech nerd who maintains a second home in Aspen, Colo., declined all requests for interviews after public disclosure of his plan to take over its much larger rival, Reynolds and Reynolds Co.

But it may not be possible for Brockman to stay under the radar much longer. With dealership management software in nearly 11,000 North American dealerships, the combined companies would be an industry powerhouse. Last week Reynolds filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission that shed new light on the $2.8 billion deal:

Brockman played hardball during negotiations, threatening to take his offer directly to shareholders if Reynolds chief Fin O'Neill and the Reynolds board said no.

Reynolds accepted the offer only after it had contacted three other companies that turned down potential merger deals.

The new entity would be a wholly owned subsidiary of Brockman's privately held company. O'Neill would be CEO of the new subsidiary. But Brockman's future role remains unclear.

In a statement e-mailed Friday through Reynolds public relations director Mark Feighery, Brockman says his role will be further defined ""after the merger goes through.""

""It will most likely be in an advisory role in the product development area due to my 40-plus years of industry experience,"" the statement said.
Nervous customers

The companies lease computer hardware and software to dealers, who use their systems to handle accounting, finance and insurance, customer relations, service and parts.

Some customers know Brockman as a tough negotiator who sets rigid terms in contracts and enforces those terms to the letter. Some dealers who don't like Brockman's business methods now are reluctant to sign long-term deals with Reynolds.

A manager at a dealership group, who asked not to be identified, says his company was going to switch all its stores from UCS systems to Reynolds and Reynolds. Then news of the merger broke.

""We won't go with Reynolds because we fear UCS will have influence on the new company,"" says the manager. ""I think that it is inevitable that some of the business practices of UCS will find their way into the day-to-day life of Reynolds and Reynolds. To what degree that might happen, I'm not sure.""
Avoiding the press

Brockman has declined repeated interview requests since the companies announced the proposal Aug. 8, but aides say that's not surprising.

""It's not normal for him to be very public,"" says Trey Hiers, a senior marketing manager and spokesman at UCS.

The company doesn't even keep on file a biography of Brockman, its founder and CEO, Hiers says. ""I don't think his role into the future has been determined.""

Reynolds' archrival, ADP Dealer Services, is trying to capitalize on the uncertainty by touting its ""stable, predictable business relationship"" with dealers. On Aug. 14, ADP President Steven Anenen sent letters to customers of Reynolds and UCS.

Anenen's letter says ""many questions remain unanswered"" about the Universal-Reynolds deal, and ""there is considerable uncertainty around the future direction and focus of the new company, whereas ADP's strategy has been very consistent and clear in the marketplace.""

ADP is the other key player in the dealership-software market, with about 11,000 dealership clients.

Reclusive salesman

In 1964, Brockman began his career as a marketing trainee with Ford Motor Co. After joining IBM Corp. in 1966, he became the leading U.S. salesman in IBM's service bureau.

In 1970, Brockman founded UCS in his living room. Initially he provided local dealerships with weekly reports of their parts inventory. UCS sold its first in-dealership computer system in 1982.

In a recent article, the Houston Business Journal noted that Brockman is one of Houston's wealthiest but least-known businessmen and an ""intensely private millionaire.""

Jane Copeland, president of API International, a dealership consulting firm in Austin, Texas, does not expect Brockman to retire.

""Bob is a Texan, the kind who works hard, and I don't think he's got any plans to stop working,"" Copeland says. ""I just think he's very dedicated to what he does and always has been. So I don't see (the deal) necessarily as an exit strategy. He's a hands-on person. I don't see him going away.""

Copeland predicts it will take two years or so to figure out what kind of combined company will emerge. ""Nobody can really predict what the outcome will be because I think it's a voyage of discovery,"" she says.
What can dealers do?

Reynolds, of Dayton, Ohio, and UCS say each company's dealership management system would be marketed to dealers under the Reynolds brand. The new company will provide technical support for both systems.

Reynolds has 10,000 dealership customers in North America; Universal Computer has 750.

The dealership group that backed away from Reynolds after the UCS bid was fed up with UCS' long contract periods and ""completely inflexible"" contract terms, the manager says. ""They'd rather litigate than negotiate.""

So the group is turning to ADP for its software, hardware and services. It's too bad, the manager says, because UCS has good software and superb service technicians.

Carousel Toyota in Glen Mills, Pa., signed a new contract for a Reynolds system the day after the merger announcement ""partly because I had committed to it and also because I thought Reynolds would be the surviving entity,"" Dan Diskin, president of the dealership, said in an e-mail.

But now that more information has come out - and key information is lacking - ""I am a little less comfortable with the situation,"" Diskin said. ""But not so uncomfortable that I will try to get out of the new contract. I'm sure that whatever changes happen will not take place overnight. And if the merged company fails to deliver adequate service, I'll look to make a change then.""

Dealer principal Joe Catania at Southern Ford in suburban Houston says UCS was inflexible and expensive. But he has seen the vendor change its tactics.

""In the beginning it was an absolutely atrocious relationship,"" Catania recalls. ""It was their way or the highway.""

About five or six years ago, ""I basically exploded,"" blasting them for the poor way they treated customers, Catania says.

""After I did that, it seemed like the company made an about-face. We renegotiated my contract. They are now very responsive.""

His monthly bill from UCS was slashed from about $20,000 a month to about $7,000 a month, Catania says. ""I think they have made a philosophical and cultural change to understanding that the customer does have some rights.""

Loyal dealer

Dan Chernault, CFO of Russell & Smith Auto Group, a Ford-Honda-Mazda dealership group in Houston, uses UCS systems in all three stores and has no plans to switch. ""Bob is a very opinionated person, and he expects to get his way,"" Chernault says. ""But I've never found him to be unreasonable.""

While the relationship can be difficult at times, Chernault says, he is satisfied with UCS products and his relationship with the vendor. Chernault likes the merger plan because the combined company will be in a better position to make continual improvements to the UCS system.

Consultant and dealer Paul MacDonald tells his clients that if they are considering a Reynolds system, now is the time to act before the merger is completed.

""The question is: Those dealers coming off their current contracts, what's going to be the business model presented to them? That's the unknown,"" says MacDonald, president of TriMac Automotive Advisory Group and vice president of Bountiful Mazda and Bountiful Lincoln-Mercury in Bountiful, Utah.

The guinea pigs will be those dealers with expiring Reynolds contracts in the next six months to a year, MacDonald says. ""It's a great window of opportunity because it still is Reynolds. So now would be the time to contract with them.""

74,John McDonnell says Treasury committee will now be 'toothless',"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has warned that the Commons Treasury committee risks becoming “toothless” after it emerged that all of the Conservative MPs on the influential committee have past connections to the finance industry.

Parliament is due to vote on Monday to confirm the election of the 11-member panel of MPs that is responsible for holding the Treasury to account on financial policy, as well as questioning the Bank of England and banking industry bosses. McDonnell said there were questions over the Conservative selections.

Four of the six Tory MPs on the committee worked at banks – including NatWest, JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers. Another, Anthony Browne, elected as the Tory MP for South Cambridgeshire in December, was previously chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association (BBA), the leading lobby group for the sector, until 2017.

McDonnell said: “This confirms yet again that the Tory party is run lock, stock and barrel by the City and bankers. The Treasury committee will now become toothless, refusing to hold the finance sector to account.”

Campaigners raised concerns that MPs tasked with holding the banks to account on behalf of the public had backgrounds in the sector.

Nick Dearden, director of the Global Justice Now campaign group, said: “This all suggests that this government will give big finance prime position as it recreates Britain post-Brexit. If so, the rest of us will pay an even greater price for the financial instability, the draining of wealth from the rest of society and dodgy tax practices bound to ensue.”

Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, is the only Tory MP who did not work in finance before entering politics.

The former junior Treasury minister founded Venture Marketing Group, an events and exhibitions organiser that lists financial firms including Barclays and KPMG on its website among clients, as well as companies in other sectors such as Vodafone and McDonalds. Stride is no longer a director of the company, which he founded in 1987. He owns more than 15% of shares in the firm, according to the parliamentary register of members’ financial interests.

The four Labour MPs and one SNP member selected for the committee did not previously work for banks. The number of MPs from each party on the panel is designed to reflect their strength in the House of Commons.

Westminster sources said that having committee members with direct experience working in the financial sector could help parliament hold banks and the Treasury to account, as poachers turned gamekeepers with in-depth knowledge that politicians might not normally possess.

One former Labour member of the Treasury committee said Browne did not perform badly at the BBA, after the former journalist was brought in to rebuild the organisation in 2012 in the wake of the financial crisis. The BBA has since been rebranded as UK Finance after merging with several other industry lobby groups.

Past members of the Treasury committee have often been drawn from the ranks of MPs with career experience in the City – including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who started the investment management firm Somerset Capital, and Andrea Leadsom, who worked for Barclays as a debt trader before becoming managing director of her brother-in-law’s hedge fund, De Putron Fund Management.

Campaigners including the SME Alliance, a group of small business owners lobbying for fair treatment from banks, said it was important to wait and see if the committee held the industry to account before rushing to judgment.

Fran Boait, executive director of the campaign group Positive Money, which acts to pressure financial regulators and the industry to serve societal interests, said that it was important for members of the committee to “prove they are able to stand up for the public interest”.

“The Treasury select committee is a key source of scrutiny for a banking sector which is funding environmental breakdown, cutting off access to cash and seeking to gain a deregulatory dividend from Brexit,” she said.",0
180,Uhuru Kenyatta,"Presidency

The ICC charges did not dissuade Kenyatta from once again pursuing his aspirations for the presidency. Kenyatta and KANU parted ways in April 2012, and the next month Kenyatta launched a new party, The National Alliance (TNA). Later that year he and TNA became part of a multiparty alliance known as the Jubilee Coalition, which also included one of the other ICC suspects, William Ruto, and his United Republican Party. Kenyatta and Ruto campaigned together for the posts of president and vice president, respectively. In light of the ICC proceedings, the eligibility of the two men to stand in the election was called into question by some, but in February 2013 the High Court of Kenya dismissed a case that sought to bar them from standing. Kenyatta went on to win the presidential election in the first round of voting, held on March 4, 2013, squeaking by with 50.07 percent of the vote. His nearest challenger was Odinga, who garnered 43.31 percent. Odinga did not at first concede. Citing what he deemed irregularities with the election, he filed a challenge to the results with Kenya’s Supreme Court. The court later upheld the election results, and Odinga conceded. Kenyatta was sworn in as president on April 9, 2013.

By the time of the 2013 election, Kenyatta had an estimated net worth of $500 million, making him one of Kenya’s richest citizens. Among his family’s considerable business holdings were ventures in the areas of media, banking, tourism, insurance, and dairy. He and his family also owned more than 500,000 acres of land in Kenya, much of which had been acquired by his father during a postcolonial land-transfer program. Their real estate holdings made the family one of the largest landowners in a country where landownership disputes were a long-standing source of resentment among people whose families had been displaced during the colonial era.

As president, Kenyatta had to deal with the increasing threat from al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group based in neighbouring Somalia and angered over Kenya’s military involvement against them in that country. In retaliation, the group launched a number of deadly attacks on Kenyan soil. Domestically, Kenyatta presided over the implementation of a new government administrative unit of counties, which replaced the previous unit of provinces, as well as fielded complaints of poor government, corruption, and insecurity.

Kenyatta continued to face charges at the ICC. Although the trial of his vice president, Ruto, began in September 2013, Kenyatta’s trial was repeatedly delayed. The defense claimed that there was not a strong enough case against him and that the charges should be dropped, while the prosecution complained of a lack of cooperation from Kenyan officials in gathering evidence. In December 2014 the ICC prosecution dropped all charges against Kenyatta, claiming that the Kenyan government had obstructed the ICC in the gathering of critical evidence and citing the widespread intimidation of its witnesses, both of which had hampered the prosecution’s case. ICC judges formally approved the withdrawal of charges and terminated the case proceedings in March 2015. They noted, however, that ICC prosecutors could reinstate charges at any time if there was evidence to support such a course of action.

In preparation for the 2017 elections, the parties that constituted Kenyatta’s Jubilee Coalition dissolved and then re-formed as one political organization, the Jubilee Party, in September 2016. Kenyatta was the flag bearer for the new party, with Ruto again serving as his running mate. In the August 8, 2017, presidential election, Kenyatta was reelected with more than 54 percent of the vote. His nearest challenger was again Odinga—this time representing a coalition of opposition parties called the National Super Alliance (NASA)—who trailed him with about 45 percent.

In a stunning turn of events, however, Kenyatta’s reelection was overturned on September 1 when the Supreme Court nullified the results of the presidential poll and ordered a new election, which was to be held within 60 days. The ruling was in response to a petition that Odinga and NASA had filed with the court, alleging that the results of the presidential election had been manipulated and were therefore compromised and should be nullified. Kenyatta, although initially saying that he disagreed with the ruling but would respect it, soon had harsh words for the judges involved in the decision, calling them crooks and referring to them as a problem that he would fix after his reelection.

The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) scheduled the date of the new election for October 17, but, after the Supreme Court released its detailed ruling on September 20 regarding the specific reasons why it had annulled the August presidential election, the IEBC pushed the date back to October 26 in order to provide the commission with more time to address the shortcomings cited by the court. The ruling criticized the conduct of the IEBC and noted many concerns with the vote tallying and transmission process cited by NASA that the judges felt had affected the validity of the election.

As the October 26 poll date grew closer, tensions rose in the country. Kenyatta and Ruto campaigned for the upcoming election while NASA and Odinga pressed the IBEC to make what they deemed necessary changes to ensure that a credible election could be conducted; they also held regular demonstrations to show support for making the aforementioned changes. The IEBC said that some of the requested changes had occurred but that others were not possible, given the time constraints and other limitations affecting the commission’s work. Meanwhile, Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party quickly passed a bill with two controversial election-related amendments in the National Assembly and sent it to Kenyatta to sign into law. The amendments, which were criticized by NASA and others, included measures such as limiting the judiciary’s ability to void an election and allowing a candidate to automatically be declared the winner of a contested post if the other candidate withdrew from an election. Although Kenyatta never signed the amendments bill, it automatically became law in November.

Uncertainty regarding the upcoming presidential poll spiked on October 10, when Odinga withdrew from it. Although Odinga believed that the IEBC would now need to abandon the poll and call for fresh elections to be held in 90 days, Kenyatta insisted that the presidential election would take place on October 26 as scheduled, with the IEBC appearing to agree with him. The future of the election grew more uncertain when, a week later, an IEBC member fled the country and resigned from the commission after receiving threats to her life. She claimed that there was no way for the IEBC to provide a credible election under the current circumstances, an assessment with which the head of the IEBC later agreed. A last-minute petition to the Supreme Court attempting to halt the poll failed when not enough of the court’s justices showed up for the hearing. Nonetheless, the election proceeded on October 26 as planned. Kenyatta won handily, taking about 98 percent of the vote. His victory, however, was clouded by the circumstances surrounding the election: Odinga’s withdrawal, a call by NASA for Kenyans to boycott the poll, and the fact that voting was unable to take place in some NASA-dominated areas for security reasons—all of which led to a low turnout that was less than half that of the August election..

As was the case with the August election, the validity of the October poll was challenged, though this time NASA was not one of the parties that filed petitions with the Supreme Court. The court dismissed the challenges and upheld Kenyatta’s victory, paving the way for him to be sworn in for his second term on November 28, 2017.",0
397,Taxes coming to big data in Germany?,"At the two-day Global Solutions policy forum in Berlin, Angela Merkel broached the topic of tax reform, but not in the way many expected. ""The pricing of data, especially that of consumers, will in my view be essential to ensure a fair world,"" she said.

Not known as a trailblazer in politics, Merkel's comments come as the current problems in dealing with data have already reached the highest levels of governments across Europe. The endless data breaches at Facebook, Equifax, Uber and Heathrow Airport — whether the information was simply lost, sold or stolen by hackers — have not only added to a long list, but have angered customers and even pushed the European Commission to action.

Only last week the European Parliament's far-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect. It guarantees the rights of everyone living in the European Union to know more about their data, restrict its processing and enshrines the right to be forgotten.

Location, location, location

Data as a raw material has often been called the oil of the future. But Merkel has taken it a step further. Instead of just protecting data, she has asked for new and innovative ideas on how to actually tax large — mostly American — IT companies such as Facebook or Google when they make money off of data.

In the new digital age, the old corporate tax methods based on where a company has an office or manufacturing center are no longer up to par. And in her eyes tax reform is ""one of the most important things"" to avoid a world that will become a more unjust place in which people provided data for free with which others earn money.

Let's stick together

Even though Germany is an industrial powerhouse, the chancellor is blurring the lines between car parts and data. Tech companies have little infrastructure and are famously mobile — usually attracted to places with low tax rates. Merkel asked why data should be treated differently than tactile things which are clearly priced and taxed, adding that these concepts ""must be incorporated into our tax system"" for a fairer world.

For its part, the European Commission in March released its plans for a more general ""digital tax"" which calls for a 3-percent levy on company revenue rather than profit. It is a different approach to years of corporate taxation, but for such a regime to work, it must also be accepted broadly across Europe. In this case, all 28 member countries would need to approve the measure.

Shifting the tax revenue to where money is made from where a company is extensively based has so far not made much traction. In the past few weeks even Germany has been a bit skittish, fearing a backlash from the United States.

And true to form at the Global Solutions forum, Merkel highlighted the importance of open markets and a ""multilateral, rule-based trading system"" without committing to anything. ""Multilateral regulations create legal certainty and thus predictability for companies.""",0
205,Terror in the Gray Area of Insider Trading?,"The recent insider-trading dragnet conduct by federal authorities, in the most public way, has created a wave of fear stretching from Goldman's offices in lower Manhattan through the hedge-fund strip of Connecticut and beyond.

This is not an accident. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission view fear as one of their best friends. They know full well that they cannot catch every violator of securities laws. Instead, they depend on the deterrent effect—which is to say, fear—to prevent violations before they occur.

But the recent terror campaign by federal regulators may be going too far. Instead of just preventing violations of securities laws, it may have a chilling effect on gathering information to aid in better investing and trading.

Although hard data is not available, anecdotal evidence suggests this is happening. I've heard from more than one independent researcher who has told me that the business has been put on hold. Normally, this time of year can be very important for the folks who conduct independent research into things like Black Friday sales. This year, at least some of their clients are worried that purchasing data developed by sector experts may lead to a raid by the feds.

The line between legitimate research and the provision of what the authorities view as illegitimate insider information is increasing blurred. Both types of research provide clients with ""non-public"" information. But until recently, only information that was purloined from inside a company by a tipster seeking compensation was considered out-of-bounds ""insider information."" The recent investigations appear to be operating according to a broader definition of insider information.

Perhaps this appearance is not accurate. It may be that the FBI and the SEC will only wind up targeting those who traffic in information leaked from inside a corporate issuer of securities. Maybe the fear is unjustified.

All of this could be cleared up if the Justice Department and the SEC would clearly lay out their theory about how insider-trading regulations apply to outside consultants and expert networks. Instead, they've left investors and researchers guessing. This has created confusion — and, worse, may be depriving the market of important data, as investors shy away from seeking the edge of intelligence.

No doubt the confusion and fear will deter. But it seems clear to many of us that what is being deterred is more than just traditional securities-law violations.

603,Crime Severity Index increase in Moncton area provoked by fraud: Statistics Canada,"According to Statistics Canada’s police-reported crime stats, the Crime Severity Index (CSI) shot up by 15 per cent in the Moncton census metropolitan area in 2018.

“[CSI is] just a way to measure how crime is being reported across Canada,” says Insp. Luc Breton, of the Codiac Regional RCMP.

StatsCan says an important factor in the increase is due to fraud.

“We realize that as the city grows, a number of different activities grow,” says Charles Leger, a city councillor and the chair of the Codiac Regional Policing Authority.

But one organization is hopeful the increase in numbers isn’t an increase in activity, but rather an increase in the reporting of it.

“Ninety-five per cent of frauds go unreported,” says Erin King, a senior education coordinator with the Financial and Consumer Services Commission in Saint John.

RCMP say seniors are a vulnerable population when it comes to fraud.

And with evolving technology, people are becoming more “creative in terms of how to defraud people,” says Insp. Breton. “As a result of that, our fraud cases went up.”

“According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, New Brunswickers reported losing $1.1 million to frauds and scams in 2018,” says King.

Some of the more common types of scams include emails, some of which say they’re from the Canada Revenue Agency, saying you have money to be deposited, but that you need to have your debit or credit card available.

Other methods can include a simple phone call.

“[My wife] got a call saying that she’d have to pay the remaining of the income tax that we (were) supposed to have, and she gave her social security number by mistake,” says Moncton resident Guy Landry.

Another resident, Daniel Leger, says he’s noticed an increase in suspected-scam activity.

“[There have been] a lot more phone calls and emails that appear to be coming from somewhere suspicious,” he says. “It’s harder to trust information coming in to see exactly what’s real and what’s an attempt to defraud you.”

According to the Financial and Consumer Services Commission, two of the top scams in 2018 consisted of identity fraud and romance scams.

“They lure the people in, thinking that there was a romantic relationship there,” says King. “The next thing you know, they’re starting to ask for money.”

RCMP are asking you to contact them if you’ve been a victim of any form of crime.

They say they’re continuing to educate the public about fraud. But despite the increase, Insp. Breton says it’s still a safe community.

“We’re talking about fraud here, we’re not talking about other serious crimes such as murders and stuff like that,” he says.

“Yes, it’s not good, but again, fraud is kind of the new trend.”",0
540,"Money Transfer Startup WorldRemit Collects Its First Investment, $40M From Accel","WorldRemit, a London-based startup that is tackling the antiquated consumer money wiring/remittance market with an easy and traceable online solution, has collected some money of its own: a $40 million investment from Accel Partners, the storied VC that has backed big consumer plays like Supercell and Facebook but also a number of financial services startups like GoCardless, Funding Circle and Braintree. This is the startup’s first VC investment, and one of the largest-ever Series A rounds achieved in Europe.

WorldRemit is addressing two different business opportunities with its product. The first is a basic consumer issue: there are a number of people who live abroad or immigrate to make more money, with the intention of sending some of those earnings back home — home being a range of different countries and currencies around the globe. They typically want easy, cheap and reliable ways of doing that, but many of the most common routes today involve spending the time travelling to a physical location that offers Western Union or MoneyGram transfers, paying a large commission fee, and then getting recipients to do the same at their end.

The second is more of a business and legal issue: financial regulators looking to reduce money laundering and funding for illicit activities like terrorism are increasingly cracking down on remittance services that cannot provide a clear enough electronic track of how money has moved.

“This industry has largely remained offline until now,” co-founder and CEO Ismail Ahmed tells me. “The market share for online remittances is just 5% today, but we expect this to increase to 30%.” Driving that will be incumbents needing to change practices to meet regulatory compliance, but also, the ongoing pressure on brick and mortar businesses. “It’s just not fit for the 21st century,” he says.

WorldRemit lets consumers make transfers from any computer or phone, and receive that money either straight into bank accounts, or mobile wallets or in the form of mobile airtime. And by its nature, the transfers are electronic and more traceable than those of offline services.

The company currently lets people send money to some 100 different countries and the funding will be used to extend that to over 200, Ahmed says.

It will also be used to extend the variety of ways that the money can be paid out: one other big issue for people sending money to family back home is the concern that it may not be getting used as intended, and so creating more channels for specific payments — say, for utility bills or education fees — is one way of solving that problem.

It’s a solution that is also being tapped by a startup I wrote about last year called Regalii, which cleverly offers its customers the option of selecting gift cards for specific services as one way of guaranteeing how the money gets spent. And these two are not alone. Just today another money transfer service, Azimo, raised $10 million. And TransferWise, which also recently raised a round, is another contender — although typically the average amounts being sent on WorldRemit are of a lower value so less directly competitive.

Harry Nelis, who led the investment for Accel, says that he was attracted to WorldRemit both because of the traction that the startup has already seen with users in the markets where it operates, as well as because of the track record of the founders.

“We like their focus on the long tail, and on the smaller corridors,” he says of WorldRemit. “Instead of focusing on Sterling to euro or to U.S. dollars, what WorldRemit does is think of how to service, for example, Filipinos in Norway remitting back to the Philippines.” He says that there are some 30-40 corridors like this one that are underserved by competitors right now, making for a very nice niche business.

What the long tail business also brings is repeat custom. “Once WorldRemit acquires customers, they end up transacting 20 times per year.”

Ahmed and Catherine Wines, his co-founder and COO of WorldRemit, both have been working in the remittances industry for 20 years. Ahmed has an economics PhD and has been a compliance advisor at the UN, with a focus on East African money transfer services, and he founded WorldRemit while studying at London Business School.

Wines is a qualified accountant who had been MD of First Remit, another international money transfer business acquired by Travelex.",0
53,HSBC plans to speed up restructuring as profits drop 36%,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) HSBC is speeding up its mammoth restructuring plan as the bank continues to grapple with ongoing headaches, from ultra-low interest rates and geopolitical tensions to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

The London-based lender said Tuesday that revenue fell 11% in the third quarter compared to the same period the year before. Pre-tax profit dropped 36% year-on-year to $3.1 billion.

HSBC (HSBC) CEO Noel Quinn said that the company would now move to accelerate its reorganization, which already includes roughly 35,000 job cuts and a dramatic overhaul of its business.

The company offered an update on those plans Tuesday, saying that the remodel of its units in the United States and Europe were on track. But it now expects to trim more costs and shed more assets than originally outlined.

HSBC said in February that it would ditch $100 billion in assets through 2022. It now anticipates to ""exceed"" that sum, it said.

The bank has also realized a need to ""adapt our business model to a protracted low interest rate environment,"" Quinn said in a statement.

""We are accelerating the transformation of the group, moving our focus from interest-rate sensitive business lines towards fee-generating businesses, and further reducing our operating costs.""

Central banks around the world have slashed interest rates to historic lows this year as the pandemic continues to weigh on the global economy. In September, the US Federal Reserve committed to keep rates near zero for the next few years, a sign that central banks don't intend to change course for some time. That's good news for anyone looking to borrow — but bad news for banks looking to get a return on their loans.

The company plans to reveal more details of its ongoing reorganization when reporting full-year results next spring. It will also then revisit whether to reinstate its dividend, which was scrapped earlier this year at the request of UK regulators. Should the dividend be brought back, it would be at ""a conservative"" level, it added.

""Any such dividend would be dependent on the economic outlook in early 2021, and be subject to regulatory consultation,"" the bank said.

One major bright spot for HSBC remains: its Asia business. The company had already pledged to shift more resources there, since that's where it makes most of its profits.

But it now plans to step up with even more investments in the region, particularly in China's Greater Bay Area and South Asia. Areas of focus will include wealth management, trade finance, and sustainable finance, according to the bank.

HSBC shares listed in Hong Kong and London jumped 4.8% and 5.6%, respectively following the news on Tuesday.

""'[The] Asian economy is rebounding strongly, led by a pick-up in manufacturing and trade,"" the bank said in a presentation to investors. ""HSBC's client activity has [also] shown resilience into the third quarter.""

However, the bank conceded that its renewed focus in Asia could become a liability. It said that any ""financial impact to the group of geopolitical risks in Asia is heightened due to the strategic importance of the region, and Hong Kong in particular, in terms of profitability and prospects for growth.""

HSBC's stock has slumped in recent months as it contends with the need to reshape its business. The bank's shares in London and Hong Kong are both down more than 40% so far this year.

On Tuesday, it warned investors once again of potential political firestorms, including ""the unrest in Hong Kong, the existing US-China tensions and the emerging challenges in UK-China relations, which in turn may affect demand for our products and services."" It also cautioned investors about the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, and the ongoing trade talks between the United Kingdom and European Union.",0

The president of Albania (Albanian: Presidenti i Shqipërisë), officially styled President of the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Presidenti i Republikës së Shqipërisë) is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the military and the representative of the unity of the Albanian people. [2] [3]

The president has the power to set the date of the elections for the Parliament as well as referendum, grants pardons and awards. In case of incapability to discharge duties of office, the Chairperson of the Parliament assumes the office of acting president until the president resumes duty, or until election of a new president. [4] The Office of the President of Albania consists of the immediate staff of the president of the country, as well as support staff reporting to the president. The office is seated in the Presidential Office in the capital city Tirana. The Constitution of Albania defines the appearance and use of the presidential standard, flown on buildings of the Office of the President, the residence of the president, the transportation vehicles when in use by the president, and in other ceremonial occasions. The spouse of the president is recognized as the first lady of Albania, but holds no official role in the presidency. She often plays a protocol role at the Presidential Palace and during official visits.

The president is elected through a secret vote and without debate by the Parliament of Albania by a majority of three-fifths of all its members and is elected for 5 years. [5] However, the Constitution of Albania sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office. [6] The president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the members of the Parliament of Albania. The 7th and current officeholder is Ilir Meta of the Socialist Movement for Integration who took office on July 24, 2017.

Albania has experienced different models of governance, including an international protectorate, a monarchy, a state-party regime and the parliamentary republic as well. Throughout all this period the function of the president of Albania and head of state has been exercised in various forms.

The first government after the independence was headed by Ismail Qemali, who also enjoyed the competences of the head of state. On 6 February 1914, Prince Wilhelm Wied was appointed as head of state by the Ambassadors Conference. From September 1914 until January 1920, Albania was transformed into a battle field and experienced the change of a number of governments, where the post of the head of state was played by different governments regencies. On 8 January 1920 the Congress of Lushnjë elected the 'High Council' composed by four members, one of whom would exercise the functions of the head of state by introducing and bringing back the parliamentarian way of governance. In 1924, Fan Noli was elected as head of government while exercising at the same time the functions of the head of state. After the frequent changes in governance, the Parliament of Albania approved and passed the republican form of regime on 25 January 1925 and elected Zog I of Albania as the president of Albania. The nation was proclaimed a monarchy and Ahmet Zogu was crowned the King of Albanians on 28 September 1928. After Albania was occupied by Italy in April 1939 and the unification of the two countries, Victor Emmanuel III became the King of Albania. From 1943 to 1944 the regencies governance was introduced once again under the German occupation. [7]

The end of the second World War and the liberation of Albania that took place in 1944 were followed by the holding of the first parliamentary elections in December 1945 and also by the transformation of the head of state 's function into a collegial body, the Presidium of the Parliament of Albania. During the communism from 11 January 1946 until 12 December 1990, the functions of the head of state were carried out by Omer Nishani from 10 January 1946 to 1 August 1953, by Haxhi Lleshi from 1 August 1953 to 22 November 1982 and by Ramiz Alia from 22 November 1982 to 22 February 1991. The 'Presidential Council', headed by Ramiz Alia was founded on 22 February 1991 and it lasted until 30 April 1991.

The election of the first president of the parliamentary Republic of Albania on 30 April 1991 by a multi political parties Assembly, marked the foundation of the constitutional institution of the president of Albania. [8]

Sali Berisha, founder of the Democratic Party of Albania.

Following the disintegration of the communist regime, the first multi-party elections in Albania were held in 1991, simultaneously with the 1991 parliamentary elections. [9] The result was a victory for Ramiz Alia of the Socialist Party of Albania (PS), who received 56.2% of the vote in the third round of the elections, ahead of 3 other candidates. Sali Berisha, the Democratic Party of Albania (PD) candidate and runner-up in the election, received almost 38.7% of the vote. After the collapse of a coalition government in December 1991 and the Democratic Party of Albania 's (PD) landslide victory in the spring 1992 general election, Ramiz Alia resigned as the president on 3 April 1992. [10] [11] One year later, the second presidential elections were held on 22 March 1992. [12] The result was a victory for Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party of Albania (PD), who received 57.3% of the vote in the second round of the elections, ahead of 5 other candidates. The fifth presidential elections were held on 24 June 2002. The result was a victory for Alfred Moisiu of the Democratic Party of Albania (PD), who was elected by the Parliament of Albania through a vote of 97 to 19. [13] [14]

The sixth presidential elections were held on 20 June 2007 with almost four rounds. In the first round on 20 June 2007 and 27 June 2007, no candidate was presented. The Government of Albania and the opposition presented their proposed candidate lists on 5 July 2007, but did not accept either list. Afterwards, on 14 July 2007 the third round were held. At least in the fourth round on 20 July, Bamir Topi won the election. The seventh presidential elections were held on 30 May 2012 with four rounds until 11 June 2012. The first through third rounds of voting were inconclusive. In the fourth round, the result was a victory for Bujar Nishani of the Democratic Party of Albania (PD). The most recent and eighth presidential elections were held on 19, 20, 27 and 28 April 2017. In the fourth round the incumbent Chairman of the Parliament of Albania, Ilir Meta was elected as seventh president of Albania with 87 votes. [15]

Oath[ edit ]

Before assuming presidential duty, the president-elect is required to take an oath of office before the Parliament, swearing loyalty to the Constitution. The text of the oath in its Albanian form is sensitive to gender and all nouns always retain a neutral form. The president-elect takes the following oath of office, specified by the Constitution: [19]

Albanian: Betohem se do t’i bindem Kushtetutës dhe ligjeve të vendit, do të respektoj të drejtat dhe liritë e shtetasve, do të mbroj pavarësinë e Republikës së Shqipërisë dhe do t’i shërbej interesit të përgjithshëm dhe përparimit të Popullit Shqiptar. Zoti më ndihmoftë!

English:

I swear that I will obey to the Constitution and laws of the country, that I will respect the rights and freedoms of citizens, protect the independence of the Republic of Albania, and I will serve the general interest and the progress of the Albanian people. So help me God!

The Presidential Office (Albanian: Presidenca) is the official workplace of the president. It consists of the immediate staff of the president, as well as support staff reporting to the president. Since the collapse of communism, the building was used as the Office of the president, having been used for this purpose uninterrupted up to this day. The building consists three floors where two entrance gates lead an oval driveway from the Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard.

The Presidential Palace (Albanian: Pallati presidencial), popularly known as the Palace of Brigades (Albanian: Pallati i Brigadave), is the official residence of the president of Albania. [20] The Palace was commissioned by King Zog I of Albania to serve as his main official residence. After the second World War it has been used by the Government of Albania for holding official ceremonies and state receptions. Due to its location near the Grand Park of Tirana, its gardens are quite extensive. It is surrounded by trees for nearly 200 metres and decorated in patterns and shapes of various designs. In addition the Palace was designed by Italian well-known architect Gherardo Bosio. [21]

First Lady of Albania[ edit ]

Main article: First Lady of Albania

During the Middle Ages, Albanians used several titles for the spouses of Albanian monarchs. Donika Kastrioti was known as the spouse of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg.

The title First Lady of Albania is an unofficial title; it is not an elected one, carries no official duties, and receives no salary. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in Albanian society. The role has evolved over the years, but she is, first and foremost, the spouse of the president. However, she accompanies the president in state and official visits abroad the borders of Albania. She generally oversees the administration of Presidential Palace, the mansion that serves as the official residence, while the Presidenca serves as the official office. They also organize events and civic programs, and typically get involved in different charities and social causes.

*Geraldine Apponyi married Ahmet Zogu a decade later.

*Semiramis Xhuvani, the daughter of prominent scholar Aleksandër Xhuvani died before her husband took office of the presidency.

*Milica Niça was deceased when Alfred Moisiu became President of the Republic, his youngest daughter Mirela Moisiu carried the First Lady duties.

*Monika Kryemadhi, as a Member of Parliament and the leader of the second largest opposition party LSI, refused to take on the duties of the First Lady therefore the couple's eldest child and daughter Bora Meta is carrying on as First Lady.

285,Trump replaces Republican head of energy regulatory panel who supports carbon markets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump demoted Neil Chatterjee, the Republican head of an energy regulation panel, after he promoted the use of carbon markets by U.S. states to curb climate change.

Trump replaced Chatterjee, who had been chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, with fellow Republican James Danly, who had been a commissioner, Chatterjee said on Twitter late Thursday.

If Joe Biden becomes president it is likely he would quickly name a Democratic FERC chair.

Last month Chatterjee had promoted putting a price on carbon emissions, an idea backed by many former Republican politicians and leading companies as a way to lower emissions of pollutants scientists say are warming the planet.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Carbon pricing has struggled to gain support in the U.S. Congress and in the administration of Trump, who doubts climate science and wants to cut costs on coal, oil and natural gas.

In a proposed policy statement on Oct. 15 Chatterjee said that carbon pricing by U.S. states is an “important market-based tool that has wide support from across sectors.” He also held a conference exploring how a carbon tax would world in power markets.

Josh Price, an analyst at Height Capital Markets, said in a note to clients that the proposed blessing for state-led carbon pricing schemes was a “direct threat to coal.”

Chatterjee’s term was due to end on June 30, and he said he would serve out the rest of that as a commissioner. He once worked on pro-fossil-fuel policies as an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of coal-producing Kentucky.

FERC, an independent panel of the Energy Department, regulates the transmission of electricity and natural gas across states and reviews large energy projects.

Chatterjee told the Washington Examiner that his demotion was “perhaps” because he has supported carbon markets and that if the demotion was retribution, he was proud of his independence.

Danly said in a statement that Chatterjee had left his mark on FERC by brokering an agreement on terminals for natural gas exports and taking other actions to help “secure our American energy independence.”",0
429,"To Find Insider Trading, Follow The Kids' Money","In New York and Washington, government regulators are cracking down on insider trading, the illegal practice in which people with internal information about important company events make stock market trades before ordinary investors find out what's happening.

In recent months, regulators have launched a series of high-profile arrests and investigations. Even Congress has gotten into the spirit of things, voting to ban insider trading by members.

Now, social scientists are muscling in on the action, too.

In a new study accepted for publication in the Journal of Finance, Henk Berkman at the University of Auckland, Paul Koch at the University of Kansas and Joakim Westerholm at the University of Sydney have uncovered a novel way to spot insider trading.

The researchers tracked half a million stock market accounts over a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010. The accounts were in Finland on the Nasdaq OMX Helsinki Exchange. Why Finland? It offered researchers unusual access to information about trades and information about investors, including their age.

To their surprise, when the researchers analyzed the data according to investor age, the accounts belonging to the youngest children blew all the others out of the water in terms of performance.

""We were very surprised when we first found this evidence,"" Koch said. ""Again, we were not looking for the result we found. The group [of accounts belonging to children between the ages of zero and 10 years old] seemed to outperform all the others.""

Koch isn't implying that babies know how to make the right picks in the stock market. The people operating these children's accounts were their parents and guardians.

How They Did It

Exactly how the researchers made the connection between a child's account and the guardian's without knowing either person's name — and without violating Finnish confidentiality laws — is an interesting bit of sleuthing on its own. First they got data about individual accounts that had the same last name, Koch says, but without being told what the actual names were. They next looked to make sure the pair of accounts had the same ZIP code, and that trades of the same stocks were made on the same day, and in the same buy/sell direction in both accounts. Only then would the researchers assume that transactions in both accounts might be being guided by the same person.

""We find that underaged account holders exhibit superior stock-picking skills on both the buy side and the sell side over the days immediately following trades,"" Koch and his colleagues report in their study. Accounts belonging to children (and managed by their guardians) appeared to be especially prescient when it came to major company events such as merger or takeover announcements.

""Since this outperformance is especially evident for short horizons,"" the researchers write, ""it likely stems from superior private information that is about to become public.""

Think about takeover announcements: Typically, these announcements cause large stock market swings. The researchers found that adults made the right calls about 50 percent of the time before a takeover announcement — what you'd expect in a world where people don't have special expertise or information.

The accounts belonging to kids made trades in the right direction 72 percent of the time after takeover announcements. Koch says this produced a post-takeover return of 12 percent. (That isn't 12 percent per year. It's 12 percent per day.)

When the researchers drilled down further, they found something really interesting: The guardians of these kids who were making these spectacular calls weren't nearly as successful when they made investments through their own accounts.

""Guardians are willing to trade on behalf of their children to earn these extraordinary returns, but they are reticent to trade through their own account,"" Koch says. ""One reason would be a fear of getting caught breaking an insider-trading law.""

Koch said that the results suggested that regulators who want to track insider trading might want to pay close attention to high-performing accounts belonging to underaged children. It's not that every profitable account the scientists identified was involved in insider trading — one would expect roughly half the guardians to make the right call just by chance. But as a group, these underage accounts did much better than chance would predict.

I asked Koch whether his findings from Finland were applicable to the United States. He said they were — and that, while information about trades and traders might not be as readily accessible to researchers, they were likely available to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigates violations and enforces insider trading laws.

Koch says regulators have expressed interest in his findings.

""I've found that the people who I know are the best fishermen go where the fish are,"" he says. ""And the regulators have their own fishing expedition. We would suggest that the age of the account holder might point to a better place to catch some fish.""",0
124,NZ anti-money laundering startup First AML raises $7.3 million in Series A,"New Zealand anti-money laundering tech startup First AML has raised AU$7.3 million in a Series A round.

The raise was led by US-basedBedrock Capital, with support from existing investors including Pushpay founder Chris Heaslip and Icehouse Ventures. It’s Bedrock Capital’s first APAC investment.

While Australia’s big four banks have regularly fallen foul of regulators over their anti-money laundering actions, along with some fintechs, First AML’s regtech platform streamlines compliance for the likes of financial service providers, law firms, real estate agencies and accountants.

Its Customer Due Diligence platform automates the identity verification of customers for complete visibility and management oversight of the process, minimising money laundering risk.

First AML co-founder Milan Cooper said the company is now looking to hire 10 new staff in Sydney in the wake of the investment and has 40 employees based in Auckland.

“Our plans to accelerate global market expansion and product development have just got a whole lot bigger,” he said.

“Interest from customers in countries like Australia and the US is heating up as businesses look to prepare for the new regulatory requirements, and we are now well placed to capture these opportunities and offer the world’s best AML compliance platform thanks to our new investment partners at Bedrock.

This is a $184 billion global market – there’s massive opportunity out there.”

Bedrock Managing Partner Geoff Lewis, who spent five years at Silicon Valley-based Founders Fund before establishing the VC investment company two years ago, said First AML is positioned to have a global impact.

“The company has built a unique technology solution that is upending profoundly antiquated AML compliance processes, while also delivering dramatic efficiency improvements and cost savings to customers.”

As the Australian government and regulators move to impose tougher scrutiny to prevent money laundering, FirstAML has already gained local traction in the market, with several top VC firms using the platform.

Blackbird Ventures is among them and business operations manager Dan Danilov said the regtech platform reduced the bottleneck caused by AML compliance by removing the burden of collecting and verifying AML documents

“Many of our investors have reached out to let us know how much better the experience is,” he said.

A second tranche of AML legislation expected to hit Australia within the next two years. Under Tranche 1 there are 15,000 Reporting Entities, with that number expected to exceed 100,000 under Tranche 2 when AML becomes mandatory for lawyers, accountants and real estate agents.

A new release of First AML’s platform is scheduled for later this month, which will include improved biometric identification for remote verification and new visual tools to help users understand the ownership of complex company structures.

Cooper founded First AML in 2017 with his two co-founders, Bion Behdin and Chris Caigou, who were working as corporate bankers when the first phase of AML regulations were introduced for banks in 2013.",0

252,"Afghan President Ghani, rival Abdullah sign power-sharing deal ending political stalemate","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah on Sunday signed a power-sharing deal, ending a bitter monthslong feud that has hampered progress toward peace and plunged the country into a political crisis.

""Doctor Abdullah will lead the National Reconciliation High Commission and members of his team will be included in the cabinet,"" Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Ghani, wrote on Twitter. It means that Abdullah will be leading the peace process with the insurgent Taliban while Ghani leads the country as president.

The breakthrough comes as Afghanistan battles a series of crises, including a rapid spread of the deadly coronavirus and surging violence that saw dozens killed in brutal attacks last week.

Abdullah had disputed the results of September's presidential election, which was carried by Ghani with just above 50% required in the first round, according to official results. Earlier this year, he announced the formation of a parallel government, undermining Ghani's administration just as the U.S. was trying to advance a peace process with the Taliban to end Afghanistan's 19-year war.

The two men, who also contested each other in 2014 elections, had reached a similar deal soon after the elections which saw Abdullah named as chief executive with powers exceeding those of prime minister. The role brought Abdullah a key role in foreign relations and investment, as well as relations with the Taliban.

""Overall both teams have reached an agreement based on which they will have 50% share in the government. The thing that is still under debate right now is about which ministry should go to whom,"" a source told Reuters before the deal was announced.

Abdullah wants to control a major portfolio such as finance or foreign affairs and while Ghani has not agreed to this, he could offer control of the interior ministry, sources said.

Washington, frustrated by the growing impasse between the two men, even after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Kabul to mediate, threatened a $1 billion aid cut if the men could not agree.

It was not immediately clear whether the agreement, if reached, would result in aid being reinstated, but it comes as Afghanistan faces growing fiscal pressures, with tax revenues falling and foreign aid pledges due this year expected to shrink.

Officials say that a deal between the Ghani and Abdullah is crucial to launching peace talks, as Abdullah's camp represents much of the country's northwest. But the talks face a number of stark challenges, as violence in the country increases and a harrowing attack on a Kabul maternity ward this week prompted Ghani to switch the military to an ""offensive"" stance against insurgent groups.

The Taliban deny involvement in the attack, but the government has remained skeptical and angry at ongoing Taliban attacks against the Afghan military, fraying the momentum for peace talks, which were due to start in March.

U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that a new date for intra-Afghan peace talks was under discussion and he would soon travel to the region and try to encourage a reduction in violence.",0
155,"Italy may deploy ships, planes to give Tunisia migrant boat alert","Italy is considering deploying ships and aeroplanes to alert Tunisia to the departure of clandestine boats ferrying migrants north to Italian shores, while also strengthening information channels between the two countries to halt the departures.

Naval and aerial assets would be deployed off Tunisian territorial waters to monitor sea migration flows, Italian Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese said on Friday at a news conference in Rome with her French counterpart Gerald Darmanin.

“We would give an alert to Tunisian authorities to make it easier to track down the [migrant] boats that leave from those territories to come to Italian shores,” she said. “Such plan supposes the full adherence by Tunisia.”

The proposal is part of an “operational plan” that Italy would like to submit to Tunisia on strengthening cooperation against human trafficking and undocumented migration.

The draft plan was first mentioned by the Italian Interior Ministry on Tuesday, after a national security meeting called in the wake of attacks in France and Austria.

More than 27,000 refugees and migrants – over 11,000 from Tunisia – reached Italy via the sea from January 1 to October 29 this year, compared with 9,533 in the same period last year, according to Italy’s Interior Ministry data.

The vast majority of Tunisians arriving by sea are rejected as they are classified as economic migrants, but while official channels established between Rome and Tunis provide the return of only 80 migrants per week, Italian authorities hand over an expulsion order to all the others.

Many of them continue their way towards Northern Europe, rather than returning to Tunisia.

The process has come under increasing scrutiny following the killing of three people on October 29 at a Catholic basilica in the French city of Nice by the 21-year-old Tunisian Brahim Aouissaoui.

He had landed on Italy’s Lampedusa Island on September 20 and later disappeared, after ignoring repatriation orders.

Last week, the Italian interior minister came under increasing attack by far-right leaders blaming the government’s “ open-door policy ” for the arrival and transit of Aouissaoui.

Darmanin said he “never at any time” thought that Italy was to blame for what happened in Nice, and said France would support Italy in its endeavours to limit undocumented immigration from Tunisia.

Since 2014, more than 20,000 migrants and refugees have died at sea while trying to reach Europe from Africa, according to the International Organization of Migration (IOM). More than 800 have died this year alone.",0
387,"Sudanese Christian, Muslim Leaders Agree to Promote Religious Freedom","KHARTOUM - Sudanese Muslim and Christian religious leaders have agreed to join forces and promote religious freedom in the country, now that the Islamist government of Omar al-Bashir is out of power and a recently signed peace deal includes language saying freedom of religion is a human right.

At the end of a two-day conference this week, the religious leaders signed a declaration to promote peace and freedom of worship among all Sudanese communities and to encourage community dialogue among people of different faiths.

Khartoum Catholic Archbishop Michael Didi said the declaration will help create space for more religious freedom in Sudan as the country embarks on a new era following the revolution that led to military leaders removing Bashir from power.

Didi said three decades of religious oppression created social stigma among different communities across the country, and change will not happen overnight.

“I think we are moving well but it will take some time because many things were planted for a long time and to uproot them and make things new, and the understanding and the change of heart, the change of thinking and the change of how to deal with one, maybe it will need some time,” Didi told VOA’s South Sudan in Focus.

Juba pact

Jibril Bilal, a member of the Darfur-based rebel group Justice and Equality Movement, said the declaration’s resolutions are in line with the peace agreement mediated in Juba, which call for a secular system of governance in Sudan with equal rights for everyone.

“The state and the government and the official bodies have to stand in the same level of the people of Sudan. The state and government have to look after the interests of the Sudanese, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, colors and all this stuff,” Bilal told South Sudan in Focus.

William Delvin, co-chair of the Khartoum-based organization Unity International, said the declaration paves the way for religious freedom in Sudan after decades of strict Islamist rule.

He called on Muslims and Christians to forget the past and work together to build a new Sudan where citizens are treated equally.

Delvin praised the transitional government under the leadership of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok for enacting religious reforms.

“I think that God providentially had us here at this time after the repeal of the apostasy law, the banning and criminalization of female genital mutilation, after the peace agreement [between the government and rebel groups] and the discussion of having a secular state, the separation of mosque, church and state,” he said.

Raja Nichola Abdul Messih, a member of Sudan’s Sovereign Council, said the government is committed to reforming all oppressive laws and promoting social justice.

Sudan can be a shining example to the world where multicultural groups can peacefully coexist, said Messih.

“Sudan is known for multiethnic, multilingual, multireligious and multieconomic social and political activities. Therefore, its culture is a mixture of African and Arab features. They deal according to an interconnected social system through which it is easy to find suitable ground for the harmony of this hybrid of all their differences,” Messih told VOA.",0

Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein (Arabic: عبدالله الثاني بن الحسين‎, ʻAbd Allāh ath-thani bin Al-Husayn King of Jordan, reigning since 7 February 1999. As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, Abdullah is a 41st-generation direct descendant of Muhammad.

Abdullah was born in Amman as the first child of King Hussein of Jordan and his second wife, British-born Princess Muna. As the king's eldest son, Abdullah was heir apparent until Hussein transferred the title to Abdullah's uncle, Prince Hassan, in 1965. Abdullah began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. He began his military career in 1980 as a training officer in the Jordanian Armed Forces, later assuming command of the country's Special Forces in 1994, and he became a major general in 1998. In 1993 Abdullah married Rania Al-Yassin (of Palestinian descent), and they have four children: Crown Prince Hussein, Princess Iman, Princess Salma and Prince Hashem. A few weeks before his death in 1999, King Hussein named his eldest son Abdullah his heir, and Abdullah succeeded his father.

Abdullah, a constitutional monarch, liberalized the economy when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring, including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighboring countries. In 2011, large-scale protests demanding reform erupted in the Arab world. Many of the protests led to civil wars in other countries, but Abdullah responded quickly to domestic unrest by replacing the government and introducing reforms to the constitution and laws governing public freedoms and elections. Proportional representation was introduced to the Jordanian parliament in the 2016 general election, a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments. The reforms took place amid unprecedented challenges stemming from regional instability, including an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Abdullah is popular locally and internationally for maintaining Jordanian stability, and is known for promoting interfaith dialogue and a moderate understanding of Islam. The longest-serving current Arab leader, he was regarded by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre as the most influential Muslim in the world in 2016. [1] Abdullah is custodian of the Muslim and Christian sacred sites in Jerusalem, a position held by his dynasty since 1924. [2]

Early life[ edit ]

Abdullah was born on 30 January 1962 in Amman, to King Hussein and Hussein's British-born second wife, Princess Muna Al-Hussein (born Antoinette Avril Gardiner). [3] He is the namesake of his paternal great-grandfather, Abdullah I, who founded modern Jordan. [4] [5] Abdullah's dynasty, the Hashemites, ruled Mecca for over 700 years—from the 10th century until the House of Saud conquered Mecca in 1925—and have ruled Jordan since 1921. [6] [7] The Hashemites are the oldest ruling dynasty in the Muslim world. [1] According to family tradition, Abdullah is the 41st-generation agnatic descendant of Muhammad 's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the fourth Rashidun caliph. [3] [8]

As Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah became heir apparent to the Jordanian throne under the 1952 constitution. [5] [9] Due to political instability, King Hussein thought it wise to appoint an adult heir instead, choosing Abdullah's uncle Prince Hassan in 1965. [10] [11] Abdullah began his schooling in 1966 at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, and continued at St Edmund's School in England. He attended high school at Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy in the United States of America. [3]

Abdullah has four brothers and six sisters: Princess Alia, Prince Faisal, Princess Aisha, Princess Zein, Princess Haya, Prince Ali, Prince Hamza, Prince Hashem, Princess Iman and Princess Raiyah; seven of them are paternal half-siblings. [12]

Military career[ edit ]

Abdullah, age 11, during a 1973 visit to Royal Jordanian Air Force headquarters

He began his military career at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1980, while he was a training officer in the Jordanian Armed Forces. [3] [13] After Sandhurst, Abdullah was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Army and served a year in Britain and West Germany as a troop commander in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars. [3]

Abdullah was admitted to Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1982, where he completed a one-year special-studies course in Middle Eastern affairs. [3] He joined the Royal Jordanian Army on his return home, serving as first lieutenant and then as platoon commander and assistant commander of a company in the 40th Armored Brigade. [14] Abdullah took a free-fall parachuting course in Jordan, and in 1985 he took the Armored Officer's Advanced Course at Fort Knox. [14] He became commander of a tank company in the 91st Armored Brigade, with the rank of captain. [14] Abdullah also served with the Royal Jordanian Air Force 's anti-tank helicopter wing, receiving training to fly Cobra attack-helicopters. [14]

The prince then attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1987, undertaking advanced study and research in international affairs. [14] He returned home to serve as assistant commander of the 17th Royal Tank Battalion in 1989, later being promoted to major. [14] Abdullah attended a staff course at the British Staff College in 1990, and served the following year in the Office of the Inspector General of the Jordanian Armed Forces as the Armored Corps representative. [14] He commanded a battalion in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1992 and was promoted to colonel the following year, commanding the 40th Brigade. [14]

Abdullah met Rania Al-Yassin, a marketing employee at Apple Inc. in Amman, at a dinner organized by his sister Princess Aisha in January 1993. [15] They became engaged two months later, and their marriage took place in June. [15]

In 1994 Abdullah assumed command of Jordan's Special Forces and of other elite units as a brigadier general, restructuring them into the Joint Special Operations Command two years later. [14] He became a major general, attended a course in defence-resources management at the American Naval Postgraduate School [14] and commanded an elite special-forces manhunt in the pursuit of outlaws in 1998. [16] The operation reportedly ended successfully, with his name chanted on the streets of Amman. [16]

Abdullah joined his father on a number of missions, including meetings abroad with Soviet and American leaders. [17] He was occasionally King Hussein's regent during the 1990s but this duty was mainly performed by Hussein's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan. [14] Abdullah led his father's delegation to Moscow for talks in 1987. [17] He frequently visited the Pentagon in Washington, where he lobbied for increased military assistance to Jordan. [17] The prince joined his father on trips to visit Hafez Al-Assad in Damascus and Saddam Hussein in Baghdad (before the 1990 Gulf War). [17] Abdullah commanded military exercises during Israeli military officials' visits to Jordan in 1997, and was sent to hand-deliver a message to Muammar Gaddafi in 1998. [17]

King Hussein frequently traveled to the United States for medical treatment after his diagnosis with cancer in 1992. [14] After Hussein returned from a six-month medical absence from Jordan in late 1998, he criticized his brother Hassan's management of Jordanian affairs in a public letter, accusing him of abusing his constitutional powers as regent. [14] On 24 January 1999, two weeks before his death, Hussein surprised everyone—including Abdullah who thought he would spend his life in the military—by replacing Hassan with his son as heir apparent. [14]

The king died of complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma on 7 February 1999. [18] His 47-year reign extended through four turbulent decades of the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Cold War. [18] Several hours after the announcement of his father's death, Abdullah appeared at an emergency session of the Jordanian parliament. [18] Hussein's two brothers, Hassan and Mohammed, walked ahead of him as he entered the assembly. [18] In Arabic, he swore the oath taken by his father almost fifty years earlier: ""I swear by Almighty God to uphold the constitution and to be faithful to the nation"". [18] Speaker of the Senate Zaid Al-Rifai opened the session with Al-Fatiha (the opening chapter of the Quran), his voice cracking with emotion as he led the recitation. ""God, save His Majesty... God, give him advice and take care of him."" [18] Abdullah's investiture took place on 9 June 1999. [19] A reception at Raghadan Palace attended by 800 dignitaries followed a motorcade ride through Amman by the 37-year old king and his 29-year old wife, Rania—the then youngest queen in the world. [19] [20]

First year[ edit ]

As king, Abdullah retains wider executive and legislative authority than is normally the case for a constitutional monarch. He is head of state and commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces and appoints the prime minister and the directors of security agencies. [21] The prime minister is free to choose his cabinet. [22] The Parliament of Jordan consists of two chambers: the appointed Senate and the elected House of Representatives, which serve as a check on the government. However, according to Freedom House, most seats in the House are held by pro-palace independents, and the crown's authority is such that it is extremely difficult for a party to win power solely via the ballot box. [21] [22] The Senate is appointed by the king, and the House of Representatives is directly elected. [22]

Abdullah's first visit to the United States as king in 1999

When Abdullah ascended to the throne as Jordan's fourth king, observers doubted his ability to manage the country's economic crisis—a legacy of the 1990 Gulf War. [23] [24] The king maintained his father's moderate pro-Western policy, supporting the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, and the royal transition prompted the United States and Arab states of the Persian Gulf to increase their aid. [23] In the early years of Abdullah's reign, which then ruled over a population of 4.5 million, it was reported that he frequently went undercover to see Jordan's challenges firsthand. [24] [25] In 2000 he said about his incognito visits to government institutions, ""The bureaucrats are terrified. It's great."" [26]

Abdullah cracked down on the Hamas presence in Jordan in November 1999 after pleas from the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. [27] The crackdown occurred during peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. [27] The king exiled four Hamas officials to Qatar and barred the group from political activity, closing their offices in Amman. [27] The peace talks collapsed into a violent Palestinian uprising, the Second Intifada, in September 2000. [28] As a result, Jordan faced dwindling tourism; tourism is an economic cornerstone of Jordan, a country with few natural resources. [28] Abdullah reportedly spearheaded efforts to defuse the political violence. [16]

2000s[ edit ]

On 23 June 2000, while vacationing in the Greek Islands, Abdullah received a phone call from the director of mukhabarat (the country's Intelligence Directorate) warning of an assassination attempt against him by Al-Qaeda. [29] The plot was to target Abdullah and his family's rented yacht with explosives. [29]

The September 11 attacks in 2001 on American targets were fiercely condemned by Abdullah. [30] Jordan responded quickly to American requests for assistance, enacting counterterrorism legislation and maintaining a high level of vigilance. [30] The country's mukhabarat foiled similar plots the following year against Western targets, including the American and British embassies in Lebanon. [31]

Abdullah and Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, Tehran, 2 September 2003

With the George W. Bush administration planning an attack on Iraq, accusing Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction, Abdullah opposed American intervention. [32]""A strike on Iraq will be disastrous for Iraq and the region as a whole and will threaten the security and stability of the Middle East"", he warned during American vice president Dick Cheney 's 2002 visit to the Middle East. [32] In March 2003, during a meeting with George W. Bush at the White House, Abdullah tried to dissuade the president from invading Iraq. [33] During the 1990 Gulf War, King Hussein's wariness of war was seen as siding with Saddam Hussein, which alienated Jordan from its Arab allies in the Persian Gulf region and the Western world; [34] his stance precipitated an economic crisis triggered by the suspension of foreign aid and investment to Jordan. [35] Failing to persuade Bush, Abdullah broke with domestic opposition. [33] He allowed American Patriot batteries to be stationed in the Jordanian desert along its border with Iraq, but did not allow coalition troops to launch an invasion from Jordan. [33] Jordan had received subsidized oil from Saddam Hussein's Iraq at a savings of about $500 million per year, equal to American aid to Jordan at the time. [33]

The 2003 Jordanian general election was the first parliamentary election under Abdullah's rule. [36] Although the election was supposed to be held in 2001, it was postponed by the king due to regional political instability in accordance with the Jordanian constitution (which authorizes the monarch to postpone an election for a maximum of two years). [36] His postponement was criticized by the largest Islamist opposition party in the country, the Islamic Action Front (the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood), who accused Abdullah of impeding the democratic process. [36] He inherited a controversial single non-transferable vote electoral system, implemented by his father in 1991, which hobbled Islamic political parties after they obtained 22 of 80 seats in the 1989 elections. [36] Abdullah issued a royal decree before the election, introducing an amendment to the election law giving women a six-seat quota in Parliament. [36]

In 2004, Abdullah coined the term "" Shia Crescent"" to describe a Shia -dominated region from Damascus to Tehran (bypassing Baghdad) which promoted sectarian politics. [37] His warning received international attention, leading Abdullah to clarify that he meant a shift in political (not sectarian) alignment. [37] The king's observation was validated after the rise of Shia Nouri Al-Maliki to the Iraqi government in 2006 and subsequent events. [37]

Abdullah and Queen Rania (third and fourth from left) during the World Economic Forum in Jordan, 20 May 2007

Al-Qaeda in Iraq founder Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack in Amman on 9 November 2005. [38] It was the deadliest attack in Jordan's history; [39] suicide bombers targeted three hotels, one of which was hosting a wedding. [40] The attack killed 60 people and injured 115. [41] Prior to the attack, Al-Zarqawi had threatened: ""What is coming is more vicious and bitter"". [40] In 2006, Al-Zarqawi was killed in an airstrike with the aid of Jordanian intelligence agents. [42] Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West. [40] Jordan's security was tightened, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported in the country since then. [41]

Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Jordan for the first time in February 2007 and was welcomed by Abdullah. [43] The leaders discussed prospects for the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, Iran's nuclear program and violence in Iraq. [43]

Abdullah established King's Academy near Madaba, the Middle East's first boarding school, in 2007 in appreciation of the education he received at Deerfield Academy. [44] He hired Deerfield headmaster Eric Widmer to oversee the school, which has students from throughout the region. [44]

In 2007, it was reported that Jordan hosted 800,000 Iraqi refugees who fled the insurgency following the American invasion; [45] most have returned to Iraq. [46] The 2007 Jordanian general election was held in November, with secular opposition groups accusing the government of using rising Islamism as an excuse for ""autocratic rule"". [47] In 2008, Abdullah became the first Arab head of state to visit Iraq after the 2003 American invasion. [48] The visit was amid Sunni Arab concerns of growing Iranian influence in Iraq. [48]

Arab Spring 2010–2014[ edit ]

The Tunisian Revolution in December 2010 (which unseated that country's president) brought Egyptians into the streets, and by January 2011 they overthrew president Hosni Mubarak. [49] Protests in other Arab countries soon followed, resulting in civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen. [49] In Jordan, opposition groups including the Muslim Brotherhood, leftists, and retired army generals protested throughout the country. [50] By 1 February 2011, domestic unrest prompted Abdullah to sack Samir Rifai 's government and pledge to follow a democratic trajectory. [50]

The 2011–12 Jordanian protests were driven by complaints about a troubled economy: soaring prices, widespread unemployment and a relatively low standard of living. [50] Although some called for an end to the monarchy, most protesters' anger was directed at politicians viewed as undemocratic, corrupt and unaccountable. [50] Demonstrators called for the dissolution of the parliament which had been elected three months earlier in November 2010, when pro-regime figures won a majority of seats. [50] The Jordanian monarchy was the first Arab regime to offer political concessions during the Arab Spring. [50] Marouf Bakhit was appointed prime minister, but protests continued throughout the summer; Bakhit was seen as a conservative unlikely to push for reform. [51] Dissatisfied with the pace of reform, Abdullah sacked Bakhit's government and appointed Awn Khasawneh to form a cabinet. [51] Khasawneh abruptly resigned in April 2012, and the King appointed Fayez Tarawneh as interim prime minister; it was the third government reshuffle in 18 months. [52]

In November 2012 the government cut fuel subsidies, driving up prices. [53] The decision, later revoked, triggered large-scale protests across the country. [54] The regime calmed the unrest by introducing reforms, amending about one-third of the constitution and establishing a Constitutional Court and the Independent Election Commission. [55] Abdullah called for an early election and appointed Abdullah Ensour to form a cabinet. [56] In the January 2013 election, pro-regime figures were victorious as opposition groups continued a boycott. [56] Since December 2012, the king has published seven discussion papers outlining his vision of democracy and reform in Jordan. [57]

Abdullah and U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C., 26 April 2013

In December 2012, Abdullah was the first head of state to visit the West Bank after a United Nations General Assembly vote upgraded the Palestinian Authority to a nonmember observer state. [58] Jordan sees an independent Palestinian state, with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. [59] Jordan, the only country bordering the West Bank other than Israel, ruled it after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and lost in the 1967 Six-Day War. [58] Its annexation of the West Bank was not recognized, and in 1988 the kingdom ceded its claim to the territory. [58]

An interview with Abdullah by Jeffrey Goldberg, published in The Atlantic in March 2013, sparked controversy when the king criticized local and international figures and parties. [60] He called the Muslim Brotherhood a ""Masonic cult"" and ""wolves in sheep's clothing"", described ousted Egyptian president Mohammad Morsi as a man with ""no depth"" and said that Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan saw democracy as ""a bus ride"". [60] Abdullah also criticized American diplomats, some of his country's tribal leaders and members of his family. [60]

Another 2013 article in The Atlantic advised him to address governmental corruption, saying that there ""is a growing perception that the degeneracy reaches the palace"". [61] According to the article, Abdullah was accused of ""illegally appropriating 'tribal' lands"" shortly after his accession [61] and members of 36 Jordanian tribes issued a statement denouncing Queen Rania's ""publicized and extravagant"" 40th birthday party in 2013. [61]

Regional turmoil 2014–present[ edit ]

I was asked many questions by Jordanians that were getting just as frustrated seeing that 20 per cent of their country are now Syrian refugees, the impact it has on jobs, on property, on unemployment. And they ask me, ""stop the Syrians coming into the country"", and I say ""How?"" When you have a mother, a pregnant mother with a child in the hand trying to cross the border, how are we going to stop her? Do we sort of point bayonets at these people that are running away from horrible and threatening lives? There is a level of humanity that we have to reach out to each other.

The March 2011 outbreak of the Syrian Civil War forced masses of refugees across Jordan's border with Syria—about 3,000 refugees per day in the war's early stages. [63] When asked about the Syrian conflict In an interview with the BBC in November 2011, Abdullah said that he would resign if he was in Bashar Al-Assad 's shoes. [64]""Whenever you exert violence on your own people, it’s never going to end well and so as far as I’m concerned, yes, there will be an expiration date, but again it is almost impossible for anybody to predict whether that is six weeks, six months or six years."" [64]

About the unrest in Iraq, Abdullah told a delegation of US congressmen in June 2014 about his fear that the turmoil would spill across the entire region. [65] He said that any solution to the problems in the war-torn countries must involve all the people of Iraq and Syria. [65] Jordan began erecting barriers along its arid 175-kilometre (109 mi) border with Iraq and 379-kilometre (235 mi) border with Syria. [66] Since then, hundreds of infiltration attempts have been foiled by Jordanian border guards who were also occupied with the flow of refugees. [67] Jordan was involved in the CIA-led Timber Sycamore covert operation to train and arm Syrian rebels. [68]

In April 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an al-Qaeda affiliate which emerged in early 2014 when it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities, posted an online video which threatened to invade the kingdom and slaughter Abdullah (whom they saw as an enemy of Islam). [69]""I have a message to the tyrant of Jordan: we are coming to you with death and explosive belts"", an ISIL fighter said as he destroyed a Jordanian passport. [69] In August 2014, thousands of Iraqi Christians fled ISIL and sought shelter in Jordanian churches. [70]

Shortly after Jordan joined the international coalition against ISIL in mid-September 2014, the country's security apparatus foiled a terror plot targeting civilians in Jordan. [71] Shortly afterwards, Abdullah said in an interview that the country's borders with Iraq and Syria were ""extremely safe"". [71] In late December 2014, a Jordanian F-16 fighter jet crashed near Raqqa, Syria, during a mission. [72] A video was posted online on 3 February 2015, showing captured Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh being burned to death in a cage; [72] throughout January, Jordan had negotiated for Al-Kasasbeh's release. [72] The terrorist group reportedly demanded the release of Sajida Al-Rishawi in return, a suicide bomber whose belt failed to detonate in the 2005 Amman bombings. [72] Al-Kasasbeh's killing spurred outrage in the country, while the King was away in a state visit to the United States. [72] Before returning to Jordan, Abdullah swiftly ratified death sentences previously handed down to two imprisoned Iraqi jihadists, Sajida Al-Rishawi and Ziad Al-Karbouly, who were executed before dawn of the next day. [73] The same evening, Abdullah was welcomed in Amman by cheering crowds who lined along the airport road to express their support. [73] His decision also garnered international support. [72] As commander-in-chief, Abdullah launched Operation Martyr Muath, a series of airstrikes against ISIL targets during the following week targeting weapons caches, training camps and oil-extraction facilities. [74] His retaliation was praised on the Internet, where he was dubbed ""The Warrior King"". [75] Rumors had circulated that he personally led the sorties. [76]

During a January 2016 BBC interview, Abdullah said that Jordan is at the ""boiling point"" because of the Syrian refugee influx, Jordan claims more than a million Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan. [77] The king noted pressure on the country's economy, infrastructure and services. [77]""Sooner or later, I think, the dam is going to burst"", he warned. [77] Jordan has historically welcomed refugees— Palestinians in 1948 and 1967, Iraqis during the American invasion and now Syrians, who make up about 20 percent of Jordan's then 9.5 million population—and, according to Abdullah, ""For the first time, we can't do it any more."" [77] [46]

Abdullah meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., 5 April 2017

The November 2016 Jordanian general election was the first election since 1989 primarily using a form of proportional representation; intervening elections had used the single non-transferable vote system. [78] Reforms encouraged opposition parties, including the Islamic Action Front (who had boycotted previous elections, including 2010 and 2013), to participate. [78] The election was considered fair and transparent by independent international observers. [79] Proportional representation is seen as the first step toward establishing parliamentary governments in which parliamentary blocs, instead of the king, choose the prime minister. [80] However, the underdevelopment of political parties in Jordan have slowed down such moves. [80]

After Donald Trump 's inauguration as United States president on 20 January 2017, Abdullah traveled to the US on an official visit. [81] He was worried about the new administration's positions on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, specifically, issues relating to Israeli settlements. [82] Abdullah met Trump briefly at the National Prayer Breakfast on 2 February, and reportedly convinced him to change his policy towards Israeli settlements. [83] This was substantiated by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said two days later that the expansion of Israeli settlements may not be helpful in achieving peace. [81] According to The New York Times, the ""encounter put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president."" [83] Senator Bob Corker confirmed Abdullah's influence in an interview: ""We call him the Henry Kissinger of that part of the world and we do always love to listen to his view of the region."" [84] Abdullah criticized United States' decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. [85]

King Abdullah proposed significant economic reforms to the country during the first decade of his reign. [86] Jordan, a relatively-small, semi-arid, almost-landlocked country, has one of the smallest economies in the region; its GDP was about $39 billion in 2016. [87] [86] Insufficient natural resources, especially in water and oil (unlike its neighbors) have given the kingdom chronic government debt, unemployment and poverty [86] which led to a dependence on foreign aid from its Western and Arab allies in the Persian Gulf region. [86] Jordan embarked on an aggressive economic liberalization program when Abdullah was crowned in an effort to stimulate the economy and raise the standard of living, and its economy has improved under his reign. [86] He has been credited with attracting foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority and Jordan's flourishing information and communications technology (ICT) sector. [88] [89] Abdullah set up five other special economic zones: Irbid, Ajloun, Mafraq, Ma'an and the Dead Sea. [88] As a result of these reforms, Jordan's economic growth doubled (to 8% annually) between 2004 and 2008 compared with the latter half of the 1990s. [86] It also led to a steady increase in foreign investment by the West and the Persian Gulf countries. [90]

Abdullah negotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States, the third free-trade agreement for the US and its first with an Arab country. [91] Under the agreement, Jordanian exports to the United States increased from $63 million in 2000 to over $1.4 billion in 2015. [92] Jordan's foreign debt-to-GDP ratio fell from more than 210 percent in 1990 to 83 percent by the end of 2005, a decrease called an ""extraordinary achievement"" by the International Monetary Fund. [93] Abdullah's efforts have made Jordan the freest Arab economy and the ninth-freest economy in the world, according to a 2014 study by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty. [94]

Abdullah speaking during a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, 25 January 2013

The king launched a number of initiatives to provide housing for Jordanian citizens, including teachers and those serving in the armed forces. [95] He established awards to encourage good citizenship, including the King Abdullah II Award for Physical Fitness, the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence in Government Performance and Transparency, the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence for the Private Sector and the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence for Business Associations. [95] To combat unemployment, Abdullah established the National Vocational Training Council and formed a committee to develop a national strategy for developing human resources to produce a skilled workforce. [95]

Jordan was dependent on subsidized Iraqi oil for its energy. [33] The 2003 American invasion of Iraq halted the petroleum supply and drove Jordan to begin importing gas from Egypt in 2009. [96] Insurgency in Sinai began when the Arab Spring spread to Egypt, where the Arab Gas Pipeline runs. [96] Since 2011 the pipeline has been attacked over 30 times by ISIL's Sinai affiliates, and the pipeline was effectively closed in 2014. [97] Jordan incurred $6 billion in losses. [97] The Great Recession and regional turmoil triggered by the Arab Spring during the 2010s hobbled the Jordanian economy, making it increasingly reliant on foreign aid. [96] The shocks hit Jordan's tourism sector (a cornerstone of the country's economy) hardest, and tourist arrivals have fallen by over 66 percent since 2011. [98] [99] However, in 2017, tourism started to pick up again. [100] Growth of the Jordanian economy slowed to an annual average rate of 2.8 percent between 2010 and 2016—down from an average of 8% in previous years—insufficient to accommodate the exponential growth of the population. [86]

Jordan's total foreign debt in 2012 was $22 billion, 72 percent of its GDP. [53] In 2016 the debt reached $35.1 billion, 95 percent of the country's GDP. [96] [101] The increase was attributed to regional challenges, which decreased tourist activity and foreign investment and increased military spending; attacks on the Egyptian pipeline; the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria; the expense of hosting Syrian refugees, and accumulated loan interest. [96] According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year (six percent of its GDP and 25 percent of the government's annual revenue). [102] Foreign aid covers only a portion of these costs, 63 percent of which are borne by Jordan. [103] An austerity program was adopted by the government which aims to reduce Jordan's debt-to-GDP ratio to 77 percent by 2021. [104]

Abdullah was criticized during his early years for focusing on economic, rather than political reform. [105] A committee was formed in February 2005 to formulate a blueprint for political reform in the country for the next decade. [105] This National Agenda, finalized about nine months later, was never implemented. [105] It included incorporating proportional representation into general elections, improving the judicial branch and respect for human rights, and tackling issues related to employment, welfare, education and infrastructure. [105] The Agenda was reportedly never implemented due to conservative opposition. [106] After the Arab Spring, a new election law in 2012 was enacted and used in the 2013 elections. [107] It incorporated elements of proportional representation, and 27 of the 150 House of Representatives members could be elected accordingly. [107] A number of political reforms were undertaken to curtail some of the king's powers, including amending about one-third of the constitution, establishing a constitutional court and the Independent Election Commission and improvements to laws governing human rights and freedom of speech and assembly. [108]

In 2014 and 2016, several constitutional amendments sparked controversy despite their overwhelming approval by senators and representatives. [109] The amendments gave the king sole authority to appoint his crown prince, deputy, the chief and members of the constitutional court, the heads of the military and paramilitary forces and the country's General Intelligence Director. [110] Proponents said that the amendments solidified the separation of powers, while critics claimed they were unconstitutional. [110]

Reforms introduced in the 2016 general election led Freedom House, a US-funded non-governmental organization, to upgrade Jordan to ""partly free"" from ""not free"" in its Freedom in the World 2017 report. [111] According to the report, Jordan became the third most free Arab country, and that the change was ""due to electoral law changes that led to somewhat fairer parliamentary elections."" [111]

In September 2016, Abdullah formed a royal committee to make recommendations which would improve the country's judiciary. [112] The committee finalized its report, which revolved around strengthening judicial independence and improving criminal justice, in February 2017. [112] The Parliament approved the recommendations which included increased protection for women against violence and better trial procedures. [112] A new law for people with disabilities was also enacted. [112] Human Rights Watch praised the reforms. [112]

On 15 August 2017, local elections were held for municipal councils, local councils, and governorate councils, which were added by a new decentralization law. [113] The law intends to cede some central-government power to elected councils, increasing citizen participation in municipal decision-making. [113] In a 15 August 2016 interview, Abdullah described the new decentralization law as ""a very important link in the chain of reforms"". [114]

Military[ edit ]

Due to his military background, Abdullah believes in a powerful military and has followed a ""quality over quantity"" policy. [115] During the first year of his reign he established the King Abdullah Design and Development Bureau (KADDB), whose goal is to ""provide an indigenous capability for the supply of scientific and technical services to the Jordanian Armed Forces"". [116] [117] The company manufactures a wide variety of military products, which are presented at the biennial international Special Operations Forces Exhibition (SOFEX)—Abdullah is SOFEX's patron. [118] Abdullah modernized the army, leading Jordan to acquire advanced weaponry and increase and enhance its F-16 fighter-jet fleet. [119] [120] The King occasionally trains with the Jordanian army in live ammunition military drills. [121]

Energy sector[ edit ]

Vandalism of the Egyptian pipeline supplying Jordan strained the country's electrical company, whose debt increased substantially; this prompted Abdullah to urge the government to formulate a 10-year plan (2015–2025) to diversify the kingdom's energy sources. [123] [124]

In 2007, Abdullah said that Jordan intends to benefit from its large uranium reserves by building nuclear reactors to generate electricity; the country is one of the few non-petroleum-producing nations in the region. [125] Early on, in a 2010 interview, Abdullah accused Israel of trying to disrupt Jordan's nuclear program. [126] Abdullah inaugurated Jordan's first nuclear facility in 2016. [127] The Jordan Research and Training Reactor, in the Jordan University of Science and Technology near Ar Ramtha, aims to train Jordanian students in the school's nuclear-engineering program. [127] In 2018, the country's Atomic Energy Commission announced that Jordan was in talks with multiple companies to build the first commercial nuclear plant, a Helium-cooled reactor that is scheduled for completion in 2025. [128]

The country has 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds exceed 7 m/s in mountainous areas. [129] During the 2010s, Abdullah inaugurated the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant. [130] In May 2017, it was announced that more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. [130] After having initially set the percentage of renewable energy Jordan aimed to generate by 2020 at 10%, the government announced in 2018 that it sought to beat that figure and aim for 20%. [131] A report by pv magazine described Jordan as the ""Middle East’s solar powerhouse"". [132]

In 2014 a declaration of intent was signed by Jordan's national electrical company and Noble Energy to import gas from Israel's offshore Leviathan gas field, a 15-year deal estimated at $10 billion. [133] The move provoked outrage in Jordan; opponents, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, said that the agreement favored Israel and its occupation of the West Bank and accused the government of ignoring renewable-energy options. [133] The agreement, effective in 2019, was signed in September 2016. [133] Separately, Abdullah opened a liquefied natural gas port in Aqaba in 2015, allowing Jordan to import LNG. [134] LNG-generated electricity saves Jordan about $1 million a day, and is reportedly better for the environment. [134]

Our faith, like yours, commands mercy, peace and tolerance. It upholds, as yours does, the equal human dignity of every person — men and women, neighbours and strangers. Those outlaws of Islam who deny these truths are vastly outnumbered by the ocean of believers — 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide. In fact, these terrorists have made the world's Muslims their greatest target. We will not allow them to hijack our faith.

In response to Islamophobic rhetoric after the 11 September attacks, Abdullah issued the Amman Message in November 2004. [1] The Message is a detailed statement which encouraged Muslim scholars of all sects from around the world to denounce terrorism, practice religious tolerance and represent the true nature of the Muslim faith. [136] The statement was adopted unanimously in a conference hosted by Abdullah in Amman in 2005 by 200 leading Islamic scholars. [136] The Message stressed three points: the validity of all eight schools of Islam, the forbidding of takfir (declaration of apostasy) and standards for the issuance of fatwas. [136] The Islamic religious consensus was unprecedented in contemporary times. [1] Abdullah presented the Message in 2010 to the United Nations General Assembly, where he proposed a World Interfaith Harmony Week. [137] The initiative was adopted, and is an annual celebration during the first week of February to promote peace and harmony among people of different faiths. [137] Abdullah also established an award, based on this initiative, for interfaith dialogue. [138]

Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem was under Jordanian rule from 1948 to 1967; it was under Hashemite custodianship since 1924, during the reign of Abdullah's great-great-grandfather Sharif Hussein bin Ali. [139] The legacy began when the Supreme Muslim Council, the highest body in charge of Muslim community affairs in Mandatory Palestine, accepted the sharif as custodian of the site. [139] He restored Al-Aqsa and other mosques in Palestine. [140] The sharif's son, King Abdullah I, is said to have personally taken charge of efforts to extinguish a fire which engulfed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1949. [141] Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock were restored four times by the Hashemites during the 20th century, and the custodianship became a Hashemite legacy given by Jordanian kings. [140] In 2013 an agreement was signed between the Palestinian Authority and Abdullah, replacing the decades-old verbal agreement which was reinforced by the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty. [2] Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel in 2014 following tensions at Al-Aqsa Mosque between Israelis and Palestinians concerned about Jordan's role in safeguarding Muslim and Christian sacred sites in Jerusalem. [142] Abdullah met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Amman in late 2014, and the Jordanian ambassador returned when Israeli authorities eased restrictions and revoked a decision that prevented men of all ages from praying at Al-Aqsa—for the first time in months. [142]

In 2016, it was announced that Abdullah would fund the restoration of the Tomb of Jesus in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. [143] The Royal Hashemite Court informed Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem of the makruma (royal benefaction) in a 10 April 2016 letter. [143] The tomb had been untouched since 1947, when the British installed steel support beams as part of a restoration project which never took place. [143] It was reopened to the public on 22 March 2017 after the renovation. [144] On 2 August 2017, Abdullah donated $1.4 million to the Jerusalem Waqf, the body that belongs to Jordan and is responsible for administering Al-Aqsa mosque. [145] An independent report estimates the total amount that the Hashemites have spent since 1924 on administering and renovating Al Aqsa as over $1 billion. [139]

In 2014, Abdullah received Pope Francis in Jordan, the third papal visit of his reign. [1] The king, Queen Rania and Prince Ghazi accompanied the pope to Al-Maghtas, the site of Jesus' baptism, on the east bank of the Jordan River. [146]

Abdullah led The 500 Most Influential Muslims ' 2016 list, published by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Center, and is third on its 2018 list. [147] Queen Rania was 35th on the 2016 list. [147]

Leaders of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre sent out a letter of support to Abdullah on 1 March 2018 after Israel shelved a proposed bill that aimed to propose new tax measures to churches in the West Bank. ""Your defence of religious freedom and Your leadership, in ensuring that the Status Quo is respected and maintained, has been crucial in our ongoing attempts to guard and protect the Christian presence especially in the Holy City of Jerusalem"", the letter read. [148]

On 28 November 2004 Abdullah removed the title of crown prince from his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, whom he had appointed on 7 February 1999 in accordance with their father's advice. [149] In a letter to Hamzah read on Jordanian state television, Abdullah said: ""Your holding this symbolic position has restrained your freedom and hindered our entrusting you with certain responsibilities that you are fully qualified to undertake."" [149] Although no successor to the title was named at that time, the king was expected to appoint his son and heir apparent, Prince Hussein, crown prince. [149] Hussein received the title on 2 July 2009. [150]

Personal life[ edit ]

King Abdullah and Queen Rania have four children: Crown Prince Hussein (born 28 June 1994), Princess Iman (born 27 September 1996), Princess Salma (born 26 September 2000), and Prince Hashem (born 30 January 2005). [3] The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Maktoum, is married to Abdullah's half-sister Princess Haya. [151]

Abdullah has listed skydiving, motorcycling, water sports, and collecting ancient weapons as his interests and hobbies, and is a fan of the science-fiction series Star Trek. [16] [76] In 1996 he appeared briefly in the Star Trek: Voyager episode "" Investigations"", in a non-speaking role. [152]

The king promotes tourism in Jordan, and was a tour guide for Discovery Channel travel host Peter Greenberg on Jordan: The Royal Tour. [153] In the program, Abdullah said that he is no longer permitted to skydive since he became king. [153] He reportedly motorcycled through northern California on a Harley-Davidson. [76] Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, one of Abdullah's brothers and president of the Jordan Football Association, has said that the king is the Jordan national football team 's biggest fan. [76] His interest in the film industry influenced his decision to create the Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts in the Red Sea coastal town of Aqaba on 20 September 2006, in partnership with the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. [154] When the producers of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen decided to film in Jordan, Abdullah called on military helicopters to help transport equipment into Petra. [76] In 2016, the king honored the cast of Theeb, the first Jordanian film nominated for an Oscar. [155]

Abdullah also enjoys stand-up comedy. When Gabriel Iglesias, Russell Peters and a number of other stand-up comedians visited Jordan for a 2009 comedy festival, the king invited them over for dinner. [156] In 2013, a video of Abdullah helping push a car stuck in snow in Amman during the 2013 Middle East cold snap went viral. [157] In 2017, another amateur video that went viral showed Abdullah wearing pyjamas helping in extinguishing a fire in a wood near the royal palace. [158]

Abdullah published his autobiography, Our Last Best Chance: The Pursuit of Peace in a Time of Peril, in 2010. [159] He documents the first decade of his rule in a manner similar to his father's 1962 book, Uneasy Lies the Head. [159] Abdullah's book contains insights into his childhood and behind-the-scenes accounts of encounters with political figures. [159]

349,The Costs of Corruption in the Public Sector,"When the Public Loses Faith

Corruption in government is nothing new. And it’s not limited to nations and governments that are developing or are on already shaky ground due to civil discord or poverty.

The issue is how we, as a world community, combat it. Because not only does corruption exact a significant financial toll, but its influence may obscure real progress that’s otherwise being made in improving systems, policies and procedures that are essential in order to build effective governments.

There is tremendous concern among world economic leaders over public sector corruption, and rightfully so: A 2016 research paper by the International Monetary Fund said it drains $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion from the global economy.

Those costs are compounded by a heavier price paid in terms of restricted economic growth, lost tax revenues and worsening poverty. But even more debilitating yet are the indirect costs that are hard to quantify but no less serious. How does a nation or a society recover when corruption has undermined trust and when the ethical standards private citizens hold are continuously being compromised?

It was an issue I was forced to grapple with myself over the course of a three-year project in Nigeria, when I was brought in by government officials to lead a much-needed and long-delayed overhaul of the government pension system. My experience leading public sector reform projects in Africa (including Nigeria) and other countries, combined with a reputation for integrity in my dealings, gave me credibility as a qualified outsider.

It was a significant challenge, largely as a result of the corruption that has long characterized the country.

Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy, but one that has seen an increase in the number of people living in poverty – about 86 million by some accounts . It’s also considered one of the most corrupt nations in the world. The 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International puts Nigeria in the 148 th spot of the 180 countries surveyed.

I was charged with restructuring a system that had been riddled with misappropriation and allegations of fraud for years. The task was to consolidate the system; separate government ministries managed their own small pension systems, but no one knew how much money was in each. There were a large number of “ghost” pensioners, whose money was pocketed by ministry officials.

The civil service pension that was brought into the new system, for example, had 103,000 pensioners on its payroll and over 60,000 complaints. A painstaking verification process eliminated the “ghosts,” but also restored the hope of genuine pensioners who had been excluded from receiving their benefits for years.

But all the good work our team accomplished – real pensioners helped and lots of money saved and safe in the government treasury – couldn’t overcome negative campaigning against our work by those corrupt agency heads who were losing control over their cash cows.

And the people?

They had been living with systemic corruption for so long that they trusted no one and were willing to believe the worst of everyone. Those are the sort of fractures of faith that will keep a country from succeeding with a progressive agenda.

Nigeria, sadly enough, is not the only nation whose progress is hampered by corruption. Combatting it can take many forms. Strengthening public financial management systems is one recommendation. The use of information technology for transactions helps. In the case of the Nigerian pension system, it helped to cut out intermediaries, enabled direct payment to pensioners’ accounts from the Central Bank and, most importantly, kept records confirmed that my effort and the clean-up work was above dispute. And, of course, stronger public policymaking is another – and one that’s at the heart of many development projects funded by organizations like the World Bank.

But there are no easy ways to restore people’s faith and trust in their leaders and institutions.",0
596,‘What a spectacle!’: Iran’s Khamenei mocks US democracy in tweet,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has mocked the rancorous aftermath of Election Day in the United States, saying the vote has exposed the reality of its democracy.

More than 24 hours after the last polling stations closed in the US state of Alaska, the battle for the White House remains undecided.

US President Donald Trump has caused widespread disquiet, even among leaders of his own Republican Party, by flatly alleging fraud.

His Democratic challenger Joe Biden’s campaign team, on the other hand, has accused the incumbent of seeking to deny the electoral rights of tens of thousands of postal voters.

“What a spectacle!” Khamenei tweeted late on Wednesday. “One says this is the most fraudulent election in US history. Who says that? The president who is currently in office.

“His rival says Trump intends to rig the election! This is how #USElections & US democracy are.”

The deepening polarisation of US politics since Trump’s surprise election victory four years ago has drawn expressions of concern even from several Western allies, with Germany warning of a “very explosive situation” in the aftermath of the poll.

Despite US allegations that Tehran sought to use social media to influence voters in the run-up to polling day, Iran’s leadership has publicly insisted it favours neither candidate, despite their sharply divergent policies towards Tehran.

Trump has led a campaign of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic republic, pulling Washington out of a multilateral deal on Iran’s nuclear programme and reimposing crippling unilateral sanctions.

Biden has signalled he is ready to rejoin the landmark nuclear agreement struck in 2015 during his time as vice president under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama.

The long sanctions have significantly damaged the Iranian economy, leading to sharp currency devaluation and high inflation.

Iran has said it will not be pressured to renegotiate the nuclear deal and will adhere to all its commitments once the US lifts all sanctions and returns to the negotiating table.

Next US leader ‘will surrender to Iranian people’

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also said if the next US administration chooses to change course, that could change facts on the ground, but that Iran is not holding its breath and would prepare for the worst.

Rouhani on Thursday said the next US president will have to give in to Iran, no matter which candidate wins.

“The US election results might be known by tonight or tomorrow and we will know who won but it’s not important. Whoever takes office, the next government with no doubt will surrender to the Iranian people,” he said.

Rouhani added that Trump “ruthlessly intensified the sanctions even in the coronavirus time”.

“They were not committed to any principles, neither human principles, nor human rights, nor international law and regulations,” he added.",0
182,Oil firm whistleblower trapped in Croatian holiday hell,"In other circumstances, Jonathan Taylor would be living the dream. Who could say no to an extended stay in the ancient city of Dubrovnik, without the hordes of tourists who normally interfere with the experience?

But for the British lawyer-turned-whistleblower, his time on the Croatian coast is more of a Kafkaesque nightmare. He was arrested on arrival in July - and has been stuck in Dubrovnik ever since, while the few other tourists who made it to the city this summer are long gone.

""All the hotels are empty now,"" he says. ""It's like a ghost town.""

Mr Taylor believes his involuntary stay in Dubrovnik is the price for exposing corruption in the international oil industry.

He spent nine years working in Monaco for SBM Offshore, a Dutch multinational company that provides services to the offshore oil and gas industry. But in 2012 he blew the whistle on corrupt practices - providing evidence about bribes being offered to government officials in return for lucrative contracts.

SBM Offshore eventually agreed to a then-record $240m (£186m) settlement with the Dutch authorities. It paid a similar sum to settle a case in the US.

And in Brazil, Mr Taylor's evidence contributed to a massive scandal surrounding oil company Petrobras.

A quick guide to Brazil's scandals

Mr Taylor returned to the UK and family life in Southampton with his wife, Cindy, and their three children. But that was rudely interrupted by police acting on an Interpol ""red notice"" when they arrived in Dubrovnik for a holiday.

Monaco's extradition request - based on allegations of ""bribery and corruption"" - was quashed by Croatia's Supreme Court last week. But the judgement directed the Dubrovnik court to ask UK authorities for a European Arrest Warrant, which would take precedence over Monaco's request.

Mr Taylor is not facing any charges in the UK. Indeed, he says he is providing evidence to ongoing investigations by the Serious Fraud Office. So that route home would appear to be blocked. But Mr Taylor says he is still hoping for a British intervention.

""They could inform the authorities here that I should be returned home as I am a protected witness and whistleblower, and there are EU laws protecting such people.""

For now, Mr Taylor is spending his days walking as much as 10km (six miles) around the deserted Dubrovnik cobbles. Evenings are spent in a bedsit.

Touched by his plight, the hotel he had originally booked for his family had been providing him with breakfast every morning. But now it has closed for the winter.

His wife has at least been able to join her husband this week. But she says the family are desperate to see him back in the UK.

""We are very proud of him. But our lives are in tatters - the children all worry and can't understand why this is happening to us when he's done the right thing. We just want him home.""

Another frustrating factor for the family is that it is unclear exactly why Monaco is seeking Mr Taylor's extradition now.

Allegations of attempted extortion dating back to 2013 from the Monaco authorities were thrown out two years ago, his lawyer Toby Cadman says. However, the reason for Jonathan Taylor's arrest in Dubrovnik was given as allegations of bribery and corruption emanating from Monaco, according to the whistleblower.

Prosecutors in Monte Carlo referred the BBC's enquiries to Monaco police, who said they could not comment.

And SBM Offshore did not respond to enquiries, although they have previously stated they have not influenced the extradition request.

His lawyer says the affair sends a chilling message to whistleblowers.

""You put your life in danger for doing what you consider to be the right thing - and this is the consequence. You will put your entire life at risk, and we will throw you to the wolves. It is going to deter whistleblowers and investigative journalists the world over.""

Anti-corruption organisations, including Transparency International, and British MPs Caroline Noakes, Andrew Mitchell and Margaret Hodge have called on the UK government to intervene. But the Foreign Office has told Mr Taylor that it will not interfere with the judicial process in Croatia.",0
513,Why is Bangladesh protesting against France?,"Dhaka, Bangladesh – Addressing a sea of crowd from a pick-up van, Junaid Babunagari on Monday noon delivered a stern message: “We want the Bangladesh government to shut down the French embassy in Dhaka within 24 hours.”

Babunagari, secretary-general of Hifazat-e-Islam – one of the biggest Muslim political groups in the country – further said: “[French President] Emmanuel Macron should beg for forgiveness.”

The crowd of some 50,000 people, almost wholly comprised of young people decked in white kurta [tunic] and topi [cap] voiced their appreciation in unison. “Allahu Akbar [God is great],” they shouted, “We will not tolerate disrespect of the Prophet Muhammad.”

Protests are being held in several Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia, over Macron’s comment that Islam is “in crisis” and his defence of the offensive caricature of the Prophet.

Tensions further escalated in the aftermath of the killing of Samuel Paty, a middle school teacher in France who showed his pupils drawings of the Prophet during a discussion on the freedom of speech.

Such disrespect of our prophet bleeds the hearts of millions of religious and pious people of Bangladesh.

But Bangladesh arguably has witnessed the largest and most prolonged protest over the cartoon row that has angered the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims.

Monday’s protest, which originated from Bangladesh’s biggest mosque in the capital Dhaka, was yet the largest demonstration staged in the country against the French president’s stance on the right to publish cartoons of the Prophet.

In the past one week, the Muslim majority nation of 160 million has witnessed at least three large-scale anti-France demonstrations in Dhaka and in the port city of Chattagram.

‘We love our Prophet’

Last Friday, several protest rallies were organised from different mosques after Jumma prayers across the country calling for “boycotting goods from France” and for severing “diplomatic ties”.

“We are on the street as we love our Prophet,” Abu Abdullah, a 19-year-old student from Markazul Aziz Madrasa (traditional Islamic religious school) of Dhaka who took part in Monday’s protest told Al Jazeera.

“Islam is a religion of peace and our Prophet Muhammad is the best human being to ever exist. I can’t remain silent if someone said bad things about our beloved Prophet,” he said.

Protesters have called to sever diplomatic ties with France [Mahmud Hossain Opu/Al Jazeera]

We believe in freedom of expression of every individual, hence we allow all sort of protests to take place in our country.

Belal Hossain, a 26-year-old khadem (caretaker) of a mosque in Narshingdi who came to Dhaka to protest, told Al Jazeera that images and caricature of Prophet Muhammad are not permitted in Islam.

“By sketching a belittling portrait of Muhammad, France hurt us. We want no ties with France any more,” Hossain said.

Mufti Fakhrul Islam, publication secretary of Hifazat-e-Islam who was at the forefront in organising Monday’s protest, said people love the Prophet more than their lives.

“We will not tolerate the slightest disrespect of our beloved Muhammad,” Islam told Al Jazeera.

Hifazat, based in Chattagram, runs more than 90,000 madrassas (Islamic religious schools) across the country.

Maulana Zafarullah Khan, leader of Bangladesh Islamic party Khelafat Andolon, which joined forces with Hifazat, said: “By disrespecting Muhammad, France has disrespected the whole of Muslim ummah [community].”

“Such disrespect of our Prophet bleeds the hearts of millions of religious and pious people of Bangladesh,” Khan said.

Silence of Bangladesh government

So far, the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has not commented on the cartoon controversy and maintained studied silence amid calls to sever diplomatic ties with France – the country’s fourth-largest trading partner.

The Bangladesh government, however, has allowed the protests.

“We believe in freedom of expression of every individual, hence we allow all sort of protests to take place in our country,” AK Abdul Momen, minister of foreign affairs, told Al Jazeera.

Momen said he understands the people’s anger on the issue. “It’s not just about France; if anyone from any country disrespects Prophet Muhammad, religious people in Bangladesh will stage protest against that, and we know about it.”

He said there is no scope of cutting diplomatic ties with France. “Bangladesh and France enjoy a good and warm bilateral relationship,” he said.

Protesters say they will not tolerate insult to their Prophet [Mahmud Hossain Opu/Al Jazeera]

The growing Islamisation of the Bangladeshi society is a big contributory factor in this regard. It has become easy to use these kinds of issue as a tool for mobilisation.

France is one of the largest destinations of Bangladesh’s readymade garments (RMG) products, which account for the lion’s share of the country’s export basket.

Last year, Bangladesh exported goods worth $1.7bn to France, making the European nation its fourth-biggest export market after the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Several French companies have medium to large scale investments in Bangladesh, from energy to construction materials, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications.

Some French politicians have already called for action against Bangladesh in the wake of the mass protests.

“Bangladesh economy is largely based on the textile industry. Western distributors (Carrefour, H&M, etc) must stop purchasing clothing. Let’s stop trading with those who hate us and favor localism,” Virginie Joron, a French politician who is a member of the European Parliament, tweeted.

Marine Le Pen, a French politician who is known for her anti-immigration stance, urged the French government to impose a ban on immigrants from Bangladesh.

Adnan Habib, a Dhaka-based banker, told Al Jazeera that Bangladesh will lose more if the relationship with France is tainted. “I respect people’s emotion about Prophet Muhammad. But to be frank, the idea of severing ties with France on this is unrealistic under the present global context.”

Prolonged protests

Asif Shibgat Bhuiyan, a popular blogger who writes on Islam, said the strong emotion of the Bangladeshi Muslims and religiopolitical opportunism sensed by the religious leaders and influencers are playing a strong role behind the protests.

“Bangladeshi Muslims are very emotional and sensitive about religious symbols. Among the symbols inviolable to them, the honour of the Prophet Muhammad is at the forefront,” he said.

Bhuiyan said Bangladesh has precedence of staging large-scale public demonstrations on the issue of violating the honour of the Prophet.

A cartoon by the largest vernacular daily – Prothom Alo – triggered protests in 2007 after it was perceived to defame the name of the Prophet.

“A large number of Muslims took to the street and the editor of the daily had to visit the top Muslim leader in the country to clear the misunderstanding,” said Bhuiyan.

He said the religious leaders of the country are aware that they cannot have a demonstration on every issue pertaining to Muslims. There has hardly been a public protest against the persecution of Uighurs in China.

“Hence they require an issue that is sustainable. It needs to be well participated and short in temporal scope – so that there is a perception of success while being convenient enough for the government to let it be,” Bhuiyan said.

Ali Riaz, who has researched on the Islamist parties in Bangladesh, said several factors have prompted these demonstrations, largely spearheaded by the Islamist groups in Bangladesh.

“The growing Islamisation of the Bangladeshi society is a major contributory factor in this regard. It has become easy to use these kinds of issue as a tool for mobilisation,” said Riaz, a distinguished professor of politics and government of Illinois State University, US.

He argued that the populist appeal of the issue and the anti-Western sentiments have brought most of the common people into the mix.

Besides, he said, some political forces are taking to the street to demonstrate their existence in the current political vacuum on a safe issue without annoying the government.

Riaz believes the demonstrations are helping the Bangladesh government, which he says, has turned into an authoritarian regime.

“First, by allowing these demonstrations to take place the government is boosting its claim that opposition’s right to assembly has not been curtailed, thus it contributes to its assertion that the country is a functioning democracy.”

Secondly, he said, these portray Bangladeshi politics to the international community “as a choice between radical Islamism and secularism, and present itself as a better alternative” despite its “[government] abysmal record of human rights violations and curtailment of fundamental freedom”.",0
421,Taxpayers will pick up bill for illegal immigrant criminals,"The Massachusetts State Legislature is considering two bills that’d make it easier for criminal illegal immigrants to remain in the commonwealth. Both bills will burden taxpayers and endanger law-abiding citizens.

The first, H.3012/S.2641, would allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. The second, H.3573/S.1401, would effectively prohibit state and local police from turning violent criminals — who’ve already been arrested for non-immigration crimes — over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

Both measures would incentivize more unauthorized immigrants to migrate to Massachusetts, which has experienced the largest increase in illegal immigration of any state in the last decade. Roughly 5% of the Massachusetts labor force — an estimated 280,000 workers — are here illegally.

This flood has left many lawful residents without jobs and depressed the wages of those still working — as unscrupulous employers prefer hiring easily exploitable illegal immigrants over American workers. More unauthorized immigration would further exacerbate these effects.

If passed, both bills will eventually necessitate tax increases to pay for public services for low-skilled immigrants, as well as for American workers who would lose their jobs. Illegal immigration already costs the average Massachusetts household $1,500 annually.

Moreover, while most illegal immigrants are not violent criminals, illegal immigration fuels criminal activity. Unauthorized immigrants often pay criminal gangs for fake documents, thereby facilitating bribery, identify theft and tax evasion.

And of course, some unauthorized immigrants do commit serious crimes. In 2015, the General Accountability Office estimated that one in four federal inmates were immigrants, and that 25,000 illegal immigrants were serving sentences in state prisons for homicide. Nationwide, from 2011 to 2018, criminal migrants committed 667,000 drug offenses, 42,000 robberies, 25,000 homicides, 91,000 sex crimes, 213,000 assaults, 95,000 weapons offenses and 81,000 auto thefts. The GAO also reported that the average criminal illegals had been arrested seven times.

In Massachusetts specifically, criminal gangs frequently perpetrate robbery, narcotics trafficking and extortion. According to the Boston U.S. Attorney’s Office, these gangs use intimidation to recruit new members — typically 14 to 15 years old — in local high schools with significant immigrant populations. Furthermore, much of the trafficking in heroin and other drugs in Massachusetts and surrounding states is controlled by gangs manned by illegal immigrants and commanded from the Dominican Republic, according to recent estimates by the Boston Police.

Common sense dictates that when state and local police arrest violent illegal migrants for non-immigration crimes, they should turn the perpetrators over to ICE, rather than releasing them back onto the streets. Regardless of how voters feel about our immigration system generally, or even most illegal immigrants specifically, nearly everyone would agree that foreigners who commit violent crimes don’t belong here.

Contrary to the disinformation campaign by its proponents, H.3573/S.1401 only concerns people already in custody for serious offenses. Illegal immigrants who’ve committed no crimes, and are simply calling or interacting with the police, have nothing to fear.

The driver’s license bill also poses a threat to public safety. Ever since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States has worked to build a secure federal/state system of identification to combat crime and terrorism. Allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses would undermine that system.

If these bills become law, they’ll jeopardize Massachusetts residents’ physical and financial safety. It’s up to voters to send state lawmakers an unmistakable message next week.",0
96,Queen Elizabeth I Biography,"Elizabeth I was a long-ruling queen of England, governing with relative stability and prosperity for 44 years. The Elizabethan era is named for her.

Who Was Queen Elizabeth I?

Queen Elizabeth I claimed the throne in 1558 at the age of 25 and held it until her death 44 years later. Elizabeth I was born a princess but declared illegitimate through political machinations. Eventually, upon her half-sister Mary Tudor’s death, she took the crown.

During her reign, Elizabeth I established Protestantism in England; defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588; maintained peace inside her previously divided country; and created an environment where the arts flourished. She was sometimes called the ""Virgin Queen"", as she never married.

Queen Elizabeth I’s Father and Mother

Elizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. She was only 2 years old when her mother was beheaded on the orders of her father, based on questionable charges of adultery and conspiracy.

Early Life and Education

Elizabeth I was born on September 7, 1533, in Greenwich, England. Elizabeth was raised much like any other royal child. She received tutoring and excelled at languages and music.

After her father's death in 1547, Elizabeth spent some time under the care of her stepmother Catherine Parr. Parr hired tutors on Elizabeth's behalf, including William Grindal and Roger Ascham.

Tensions with Parr over Parr's new husband, Thomas Seymour, led Elizabeth to return to the royal estate at Hatfield, away from the court. Her relationship with Seymour later came under scrutiny, and Seymour was tried for conspiring to wed Elizabeth in a bid to gain power. Found guilty, Seymour was executed.

Elizabeth I of England’s Siblings

Elizabeth had an older half-sister, Mary Tudor, who was the king’s first child with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and the only to survive to adulthood. Elizabeth also had a younger half-brother, Edward, who was the king’s first and only legitimate son with his third wife, Jane Seymour.

Elizabeth and Mary were declared to be illegitimate as their father sought to pave the way to the throne for Edward, his male heir. The girls were later reinstated as potential heirs. Upon Henry VIII’s death in 1547, Edward succeeded his father as King Edward VI.

Edward VI died just six years later, in 1553. Mary Tudor and their cousin, Lady Jane Grey, both were in line for the crown.

Edward had appointed Grey to be his successor. Her reign proved to be very short: Mary gained the support of the English people and unseated Grey after only nine days on the throne.

Even though Elizabeth supported Mary in her coup, she was not free from suspicion. A staunch Roman Catholic, Mary sought to restore her country back to her faith, undoing her father's break from the Pope. While Elizabeth went along with the religious change, she remained a candidate for the throne for those who wanted a return to Protestantism.

In 1554, Thomas Wyatt organized a rebellion against Mary in the hopes of making Elizabeth queen and restoring Protestantism to England. His plot was uncovered, and Mary quickly imprisoned Elizabeth. Although Elizabeth disputed any involvement in the conspiracy, her sister was not wholly convinced.

Although she was soon released, Elizabeth's life was firmly in her sister's hands. Wyatt was executed, but he maintained that Elizabeth was not aware of the rebellion. Elizabeth eventually returned to Hatfield and continued with her studies. In 1558, Elizabeth ascended to the throne upon Mary Tudor’s death.

Elizabeth I’s Reign

Elizabeth ruled for 44 years, from 1558 until her death in 1603.

Elizabeth I inherited a number of problems stirred up by her half-sister Mary. The country was at war with France, which proved to be a tremendous drain on the royal coffers.

There was also great tension between different religious factions after Mary worked to restore England to Roman Catholicism by any means necessary. Mary had earned herself the nickname Bloody Mary for ordering the execution of 300 Protestants as heretics.

Elizabeth acted swiftly to address these two pressing issues. During her first session of Parliament in 1559, she called for the passage of the Act of Supremacy, which re-established the Church of England, and the Act of Uniformity, which created a common prayer book.

Elizabeth took a moderate approach to the divisive religious conflict in her country. ""There is one Jesus Christ,"" she once said. ""The rest is a dispute over trifles.""

Historians differ on the extent that Catholics suffered religious persecution and execution under Elizabeth’s reign. The Roman Catholic Church took a dim view of her actions, and in 1570, Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth.

With the assistance of her key advisor, William Cecil, Elizabeth ended England’s war with France. She was able to avoid clashing with the other superpower of the age, Spain, for much of her reign.

In 1585, however, Elizabeth entered the fray to support the Protestant rebellion against Spain in the Netherlands. Spain then set its sights on England, but the English navy was able to defeat the infamous Spanish Armada in 1588. According to several reports, the weather proved to be a deciding factor in England's victory.

Elizabethan England

Elizabeth’s reign was sometimes referred to as the England's Golden Age or Elizabethan England, an era of peace and prosperity when the arts had a chance to blossom with Elizabeth's support.

While she worked hard at court, Elizabeth took time for leisurely pursuits. She loved music and could play the lute. Thomas Tallis and William Byrd were among her court musicians. Elizabeth also enjoyed dancing and watching plays. Elizabeth's reign supported the creation of works by such greats as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe.

Writers paid tribute to the queen in many literary forms. The poet Edmund Spenser based his character of Gloriana in The Faerie Queen on Elizabeth, and she was sometimes referred to by this name.

Portraiture was the reigning form of painting at the time, and artists honored Elizabeth by painting her portrait. These images reveal that Elizabeth was an early fashionista in many ways. She loved jewelry and beautiful clothing; her garments were often made with gold and silver. With the help of makeup, Elizabeth cultivated a dramatically pale look.

Rivalry Between Queen Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots

During Elizabeth’s rule, Mary, Queen of Scots lay claim to the English crown and posed one of the greatest internal threats to remove her cousin from the throne. Mary was raised Catholic and was considered by many English Catholics to be the rightful monarch of England.

The daughter of King James V of Scotland, Mary Stuart united her country with France in 1558 when she married the future King Francis II. After Francis' death, Mary returned to Scotland in 1561.

Elizabeth jailed her cousin in 1567 in connection with several assassination attempts, including the Babington Plot. Elizabeth kept Mary imprisoned for nearly 20 years before she had her cousin executed in 1587.

Later Years

Troubled times marked the final years of Elizabeth's reign. The country suffered from failed crops, unemployment and inflation. There were riots over food shortages and rebellions in Ireland.

Elizabeth faced many challenges to her authority, including from one of her favorite noblemen, Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex. She had sent him to Ireland to quell a rebellion known as the Nine Years War led by Gaelic lord Hugh O'Neill. Instead, Essex returned to England and sought to start his own rebellion. He was executed for treason in 1601.

Elizabeth I’s Golden Speech

Despite her fading power, Elizabeth still showed her devotion to her people. She gave one of her most famous speeches in 1601 to Parliament.

During what is referred to as her ""Golden Speech,"" a self-reflective Elizabeth seemed to look back on her long reign. ""Of myself I must say this, I was never any greedy, scraping grasper, nor a strait, fast-holding prince, nor yet a waster. My heart was never set on worldly goods but for my subjects' good.""

While the end of her reign had been difficult, Elizabeth is largely remembered as a queen who supported her people. Her lengthy time on the throne provided her subjects with stability and consistency. Her political acumen, sharp wit and clever mind helped navigate the nation through many religious, social and governmental challenges.

Did Queen Elizabeth I Have a Husband or Children?

Elizabeth never married or had children; she seemed to have no interest in sharing power with a spouse. Over time, she cultivated her image as a queen married to her job and her people, earning her the nickname the ""Virgin Queen.""

Succession was a pressing issue for Elizabeth. During her reign, she managed a number of suitors and potential royal matches. Through her father and her sister, however, Elizabeth had seen the troubles and challenges of royal marriages.

Elizabeth's half-sister Mary Tudor had made an unpopular choice in marrying Philip II of Spain, who shared her devotion to the Roman Catholic faith. In the hopes of reuniting their two countries once more, Phillip offered to wed Elizabeth at one time. She refused.

Other suitors for Elizabeth's hand included the Archduke Charles of Austria and the future King Henry III of France. She used her availability as a means to political ends, but she never agreed to marriage.

Elizabeth herself seemed to have some interest in a member of her court, Robert Dudley. Their relationship was the subject of much gossip and speculation; both parties came under suspicion of the mysterious death of Dudley's wife.

Queen Elizabeth I’s Death

Elizabeth died on March 24, 1603, at Richmond Palace in Surrey. It’s believed that the cosmetic concoction Elizabeth used to cultivate her infamously pale look, called the ""spirits of Saturn"" — made by mixing white lead and vinegar — may have impacted her health.

Successor to Queen Elizabeth I

Because Elizabeth I had no children, with her death came the end of the house of Tudor — a royal family that had ruled England since the late 1400s. The son of her former rival and cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, succeeded her on the throne as James I.

354,South Africa’s draft procurement bill falls short of what’s required to fight corruption,"Public procurement is the single largest corruption risk, particularly in developing countries. Transparency International estimates that governments in low- and middle-income countries spend about 50% of public funds buying goods and services from the private sector. This compares with just 30% in high-income countries.

It’s therefore no surprise that public procurement systems in developing countries are especially vulnerable to corruption.

South Africa is no exception. The deep fragmentation of laws governing procurement has arguably contributed to ineffective regulation and public oversight. The country’s recently proposed draft Public Procurement Bill is a welcome development, since it aims to create a single regulatory framework to address this.

Yet the bill introduces confidentiality clauses so dubious as to be regressive. Several researchers and civil society organisations have responded to the draft with submissions showing that in its current form it would continue to enable corrupt, inefficient and ineffective procurement.

It’s not too late to rectify the draft bill so that it supports the public oversight required to achieve the developmental needs of an emerging democracy. Instead of promoting secrecy and disabling public participation, the bill should enshrine transparency and public oversight.

Weak procurement legislation leaves the public purse exposed

The importance of opening procurement to rigorous public oversight cannot be overstated.

South Africa has made strides in ensuring that its budget processes are transparent. For example, Nigeria’s former Minister of Finance, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, recently praised the levels of fiscal transparency achieved by the South African government.

However, budget transparency alone isn’t enough to combat fraud and maladministration. Openness must extend to procurement and spending data. And this must be embedded in mechanisms allowing for rigorous public participation and oversight.

Both Iweala, who has strong expertise in public finance, and the Open Contracting Partnership, whose procurement applications have been used in reform initiatives around the world, contend that the best way to ensure that (emergency) procurement meets its core objectives is to publish all tenders and contracts. South Africa is doing some of this. But the COVID-19 procurement information that has been published is not comprehensive.

Allegations of graft in COVID-19-related procurement by various government departments, elected representatives and for-profit companies have highlighted the risks of opacity in procurement. In response to these allegations, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a proclamation authorising the Special Investigating Unit to investigate all purchases by state institutions of goods and services relating to COVID-19.

This was followed by the requirement for departments to submit comprehensive information on COVID-19 tenders. While publishing this procurement information is an important step, more needs to be done.

A special report by the Auditor-General identified “clear signs of overpricing, unfair processes, potential fraud and supply chain management legislation being sidestepped”. The findings by the Auditor-General indicate weak, unreliable procurement control environments in departments.

What’s missing

The reform of public procurement has the potential to address the poor legislative environment repeatedly flagged by the Auditor-General. But in its current form the draft bill represents a disappointing missed opportunity.

The bill doesn’t commit to the proactive disclosure of procurement information. There is currently no clear provision guiding the disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process using centralised, interoperable e-platforms. This would ensure whole-cycle monitoring and transparency.

The draft bill and current practices are also light on real-time monitoring arrangements and provisions to stop bad practices as they occur.

Worryingly, the bill contains various references to confidential information, but contains no definition of “confidential information”. This omission is consequential because the confidentiality of procurement information is frequently cited as a ground for refusing to make information public.

Moreover, if a bidder believes that another has submitted fraudulent tender documents and attempts to make this public, then the bidder will be debarred for breaching confidentiality. The effect of this is to penalise whistle-blowing. This contradicts the bill’s stated purpose of fostering transparency.

We therefore conclude that the net effect of the current formulation would be to legislate a regression in transparency. This would enable corrupt, inefficient and ineffective procurement to continue.

Procurement in participatory democracy represents more than mere business. It constitutes the single largest product market. As such, it is central to managing the country’s finances. It is also about transformative development and a stronger social compact.

That’s why ensuring that procurement is effectively monitored by both civil servants and members of the public is vital.

Good practice

It’s not too late to amend the draft bill.

Bringing about substantive procurement reform will require making decisions that are difficult politically, but that are easy when social justice is at the centre.

South Africa has a real opportunity to put the social contract to work in a sincere way – by bringing social partners in to act against corruption. There are international examples that illustrate the value of meaningful public participation in the procurement monitoring process. Public observation of the results of procurement and tracking of the process from beginning to end can ensure a culture of sound financial management is instituted across all departments and entities.

It is time that the societal benefits of an efficient, effective spend of public finances are realised. This requires opening procurement to rigorous public participation and oversight.",0
416,Albania’s Edi Rama breaks with the EU,"Once upon a time, Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama use to cultivate the image of an artist-politician who impressed the grandees of world politics by appearing in sneakers at their summits. He pretended to be the confidante of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Balkans and also to have the ear of French President Emmanuel Macron and carefully built an image that he would own the international community, no matter what.

The spread of this image by an international network of fellow Socialists, the paid lobbyists, personal friends and assorted media drowned the voices of the very few expats in Tirana who were flabbergasted to see a very different reality. Their reports of arbitrariness, top-level corruption and collusion with the underworld compared starkly to the rosy picture painted in the progress reports by former the European Commission’s foreign policy guru (and fellow Socialist), Federica Mogherini, and generally dismissed.

Alas, none of this brought Albania the coveted opening of accession talks. The EU member states, aware of the problems within the Commission, imposed more than a dozen conditions to be fulfilled prior to the talks. They started to check the implementation themselves through their bilateral embassies, but Rama still sort of managed to keep appearances and sometimes even to mock the EU by publicly denying the existence of the EU conditions.

This, however, couldn’t last very long.

Rama’s last antics was to breach an agreement with the opposition that the EU and the US, aiming at orderly elections and post-election day stability, worked hard to facilitate and to successfully conclude on June 5. Surprisingly, Rama changed view abruptly and in October unilaterally amended the Electoral Code by scrapping the pre-electoral coalitions. His obvious goal was to wrong-foot the opposition alliance, which is comprised of many parties.

President Ilir Meta, who has had a tense relationship with Rama over the last two years, sent the law back to parliament and also referred the amendments to the Venice Commission, an eminent body of jurists from the Council of Europe, claiming violations of the constitution and European norms (Albania is still without a Constitutional Court following a misguided justice reform).

This would have been a déjà vu if the current Enlargement Commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi, broke with his Commission’s legacy of turning a blind eye to various democratic transgressions, and in some cases, even justifying them. He called on Rama on October 26 to ask that the vote be delayed until the beginning of December when the Venice Commission would have published its opinion on the case.

Rama flatly rejected this request as he would tell news reporters the next day. Varhelyi took to Twitter to say that he trusted “that the Venice Commission will provide swift advice to Albanian stakeholders on the implementation of Constitutional Changes of July 30. Parliament should consider waiting for a revote and take this advice into account while looking forward to free and fair elections in April 2021.

Varhelyi repeated this same claim the next day. The European Parliament, which had issued a cross-party statement in July warning Rama not to breach the deal with the opposition, openly backed Varhelyi. Several MEPs issued statements including the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee David McAllister, who wanted to wait for the Venice Commission in order to avoid further polarization and not imperil the next EU integration steps.

On day eight of voting, an MEP addressed Rama In a scathing open letter calling on him “to put first the interests of the Albanian democracy and her European perspective and to refrain from voting on the amendments in parliament until the Venice Commission has spoken”.

The MEP expressed dismay about the breach of the agreement with the opposition in its letter and Rama’s attempt to gain an advantage in the distribution of parliamentary seats and stressed that rejecting Varhelyi’s advice might lead to decoupling from North Macedonia with the latter moving faster towards the EU.

Of course, at this juncture, this verbal barrage didn’t deter Rama. But with the Venice Commission in the pipeline and having burned bridges in Brussels, Rama cannot claim to be the well-dressed emperor while he’s naked. He is already exposed, both domestically and internationally.",0

435,"Ex-President Awarded High Medal, Meta Gathers all Political Forces","On the occasion of his 76th birth anniversary, former President, Prof. Dr. Rexhep Meidani, received the highest Decoration of the “National Flag” by the President of the Republic Ilir Meta, in recognition of Meidani’s high state and patriotic responsibility shown as President of the Republic of Albania in the years 1997-2002; for the valuable contribution given to the important reform of the new Constitution of the Republic of Albania and to the holding of the referendum of its adoption in 1998, as well as to the development of democracy and to the establishment and strengthening of independent institutions in Albania. He was also honored about his endeavors in support of the cause of Kosovo in particular and the national one in general.

The solemn ceremony organized on Monday on this occasion was attended by the President of Kosovo, Hashim Thaçi, former Albanian Presidents, Sali Berisha, Bujar Nishani and Bamir Topi, leader of the United Opposition, Lulzim Basha, former prime minister and Minister for Diaspora, Pandeli Majko, President of the Academy of Sciences, Skënder Gjinushi, as well as MPs, politicians, diplomats, academics, scientists, journalists and prominent personalities from Albania and Kosovo.

“He took office as Head of State in the most critical moments for the country, in 1997, successfully contributing to the restoration of the institutional order and the Albanian state itself. Professor Meidani’s contribution to the important reform of the new Constitution of the Republic of Albania and to the success of the referendum for its adoption in 1998 remains of special importance,” said Meta in his remarks

In his welcoming speech to family, friends, colleagues and guests, President Meta noted:

Dear ladies and gentlemen,

""Education and morality create the good man, the good statesman, the good leader,"" Aristotle teaches us.

I started with these words of a great man because they best embody the figure and personality of Prof. Dr. Rexhep Meidani, who has not only reached the peaks of education but has been and continues to be a prominent example of morality, values ​​and human dignity; a true statesman, a President and politician, academic and civic figure, always distinguished for modesty, responsibility and positive impact on our country and society.

Public life of Prof. Dr. Rexhep Meidani is known and appreciated by all Albanians for the high state and patriotic responsibility that he showed as President of the Republic in 1997-2002, years which are known as one of the most difficult in the post-communist period.

Not only in the position of Head of State, but also earlier, Professor Meidani has made a great contribution to the consolidation and development of that ideal in which he has always believed with great strength and stability, democracy, working diligently for the transmission of inclusive spirit in politics, governance, institutions and society.

By investing all his intellectual, political and human capacity, in the service of establishing and strengthening independent institutions in Albania.

He took office as Head of State in the most critical moments for the country, such as 1997, successfully contributing to the restoration of the institutional order and the Albanian state itself.

Of special importance remains the contribution of Professor Meidani in the important reform of the new Constitution of the Republic of Albania and for the success of the referendum of its adoption in 1998.
That historic moment, the adoption by referendum of the Constitution of Albania, drafted by the brightest minds of the country and the Venice Commission, and based on the most valuable examples and principles of democracy and separation of powers, in accordance with the most advanced standards European, testifies to the great will that real personalities and statesmen of the time, such as Professor Meidani, and many other well-known figures, had the sovereignty in the Republic of Albania to belong only to the Albanian people.

That historic moment served as the most important milestone and cornerstone in the recovery of the rule of law in Albania.

“The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the insistence of every citizen to protect it. Only if every citizen does his part to protect it, are constitutional rights secure,"" said Albert Einstein, the man and genius of science.

Therefore, Professor Meidani, coming from the field of science and physics, under his institutional responsibility believed and contributed that the Constitution of the country should belong only to the citizens and through the referendum, the Albanian people to give its final verdict.

Professor Meidani is known and appreciated for his tireless and fruitful efforts in support of the cause of Kosova.

He was the President of Albania during the Kosova War and of the great hospitality that our country reserved for the 1 million brothers and sisters from Kosova, who, forced by the Milosevic genocide, took refuge in Albania and were welcomed by Albanian families, found warmth from the historical solidarity of Kukës but also in every Albanian hearth from Tropoja to Saranda.

The role of President Meidani's national unity in that historic moment was an added value for all political forces, even though we came from a deep division of 1997, to emerge as a nation with one attitude.

On May 24, 2000, President Rexhep Meidani visited Kosovo, marking the first visit by a head of state since the establishment of the Albanian state.

President of the Republic of Albania, MP and politician, Professor Meidani is a prominent personality in the academic field with a prominent scientific activity with valuable academic achievements.

As a member of the Academy of Sciences of Albania, honoris causa from various universities inside and outside the country; holder of many honorary titles and academic degrees from many foreign institutions from the US, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, but also those of Albanian areas such as Kosova, Montenegro and North Macedonia, and as the author of scientific and political writings and publications, Professor Meidani remains one of the most prominent personalities of our country, of which we are proud everywhere.

His deep scientific and academic knowledge and insights, but also his extensive state and political experience, intertwined with outstanding human values ​​have been transmitted to many generations of students who always remember Rexhep Meidani as their model Professor.
The modesty and professionalism, the extraordinary display of statehood and patriotism that Professor Meidani has shown throughout his career and life, should serve as an example for today's politicians.

To place the Homeland and the nation before every ambition of power; to promote democracy when the constitutional and institutional order is violated; to unite the country when there are serious attempts to divide it.

To help and not hinder Albania's journey towards the European family; to show institutional accountability at every level of government or state; and above all to preserve and protect all those achievements and Euro-Atlantic commitments that our country has gained with so much effort and sacrifice.

I was honored to work in the role of Prime Minister of Albania in the years 1999-2002 with a President of the Republic with full integrity, dignity and with very high state responsibilities as Professor Meidani.

But today I am even more privileged to award to Professor Meidani, such a prominent personality with rare values ​​for our country, the ""National Flag Decoration"".

“A statesman is a politician who puts himself in the service of the nation. A politician is a leader who puts the nation at the service of himself,"" said George Pompidou.

Professor Meidani thank you for always putting yourself and all your skills in the service of the nation.

And today, on the occasion of the 76th anniversary of your birth, I wish you health and prosperity, and on behalf of all Albanians I express my gratitude for all your very valuable contribution to Albania and Albanians "", - said President Meta.",0

LONDON, Oct. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ: EPAY), a leading provider of financial technology that makes complex business payments simple, smart and secure, today announced a partnership with Dow Jones Risk & Compliance, that adds key data to Bottomline’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing monitoring and screening capabilities, used to identify and thwart illicit transactions.

Dow Jones’s risk data, including politically exposed persons (PEPs), sanctions lists and adverse media entities for the UK, Europe and the Asia Pacific, will flow through Bottomline’s cyber fraud and risk management platform. The additional intelligence will help identify internal and external threats and protect against criminal activity. The data inclusion can also help banks and corporates avoid incurring regulatory fines and reputational damage that often accompany fraud incidents by enabling them to identify suspicious transactions and stop payments fast.

“Our partnership with Dow Jones benefits customers by protecting their payments across the entire lifecycle,” said James Richardson, Head of Market Development Risk & Compliance at Bottomline. “The Dow Jones data feeds for UK, Europe and the Asia Pacific, combined with Bottomline’s compliance solutions, will help to identify and mitigate payments to sanctioned entities, known money launderers and the risk of fraud and financial crime.”

“As criminals find more sophisticated methods to conceal illicit funds, access to quality, reliable and timely data has never been more important in the fight against financial crime,” said Guy Harrison, General Manager of Dow Jones Risk & Compliance. “This partnership with Bottomline will enable businesses to better identify suspicious activity that may be linked to money laundering or terrorist financing – helping combat one of the most pressing issues of our time, as we seek to build a safer global financial ecosystem.”",0
483,Elizabeth I (r.1558-1603),"Her early life was full of uncertainties, and her chances of succeeding to the throne seemed very slight once her half-brother Edward was born in 1537. She was then third in line behind her Roman Catholic half-sister, Princess Mary. Roman Catholics, indeed, always considered her illegitimate and she only narrowly escaped execution in the wake of a failed rebellion against Queen Mary in 1554.

Elizabeth succeeded to the throne on her half-sister's death in November 1558. She was very well-educated (fluent in five languages), and had inherited intelligence, determination and shrewdness from both parents.

Her 45-year reign is generally considered one of the most glorious in English history. During it a secure Church of England was established. Its doctrines were laid down in the 39 Articles of 1563, a compromise between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.

Elizabeth herself refused to 'make windows into men's souls ... there is only one Jesus Christ and all the rest is a dispute over trifles'; she asked for outward uniformity.

Most of her subjects accepted the compromise as the basis of their faith, and her church settlement probably saved England from religious wars like those which France suffered in the second half of the 16th century.

Although autocratic and capricious, Elizabeth had astute political judgement and chose her ministers well; these included William Cecil, later Lord Burghley (Secretary of State), Sir Christopher Hatton (Lord Chancellor) and Sir Francis Walsingham (in charge of intelligence and also a Secretary of State).

Overall, Elizabeth's administration consisted of some 600 officials administering the great offices of state, and a similar number dealing with the Crown lands (which funded the administrative costs). Social and economic regulation and law and order remained in the hands of the sheriffs at local level, supported by unpaid justices of the peace.

Elizabeth's reign also saw many brave voyages of discovery, including those of Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and Humphrey Gilbert, particularly to the Americas. These expeditions prepared England for an age of colonisation and trade expansion, which Elizabeth herself recognised by establishing the East India Company in at the very end of 1599.

The arts flourished during Elizabeth's reign. Country houses such as Longleat and Hardwick Hall were built, miniature painting reached its high point, theatres thrived - the Queen attended the first performance of Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Composers such as William Byrd and Thomas Tallis worked in Elizabeth's court and at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace.

The image of Elizabeth's reign is one of triumph and success. The Queen herself was often called 'Gloriana', 'Good Queen Bess' and 'The Virgin Queen'.

Investing in expensive clothes and jewellery (to look the part, like all contemporary sovereigns), she cultivated this image by touring the country in regional visits known as 'progresses', often riding on horseback rather than by carriage. Elizabeth made at least 25 progresses during her reign.

However, Elizabeth's reign was one of considerable danger and difficulty for many, with threats of invasion from Spain through Ireland, and from France through Scotland. Much of northern England was in rebellion in 1569-70. A papal bull of 1570 specifically released Elizabeth's subjects from their allegiance, and she passed harsh laws against Roman Catholics after plots against her life were discovered.

One such plot involved Mary, Queen of Scots, who had fled to England in 1568 after her second husband, Henry, Lord Darnley's, murder and her subsequent marriage to a man believed to have been involved in his murder, James, Earl of Bothwell..

As a likely successor to Elizabeth, Mary spent 19 years as Elizabeth's prisoner because Mary was the focus for rebellion and possible assassination plots, such as the Babington Plot of 1586.

Mary was also a temptation for potential invaders such as Philip II. In a letter of 1586 to Mary, Elizabeth wrote, 'You have planned ... to take my life and ruin my kingdom ... I never proceeded so harshly against you.' Despite Elizabeth's reluctance to take drastic action, on the insistence of Parliament and her advisers, Mary was tried, found guilty and executed in 1587.

In 1588, aided by bad weather, the English navy scored a great victory over the Spanish invasion fleet of around 130 ships - the 'Armada'. The Spanish Armada was intended to overthrow the Queen and re-establish Roman Catholicism by conquest, as Philip II believed he had a claim to the English throne through his marriage to Mary.

During Elizabeth's long reign, the nation also suffered from high prices and severe economic depression, especially in the countryside, during the 1590s. The war against Spain was not very successful after the Armada had been beaten and, together with other campaigns, it was very costly.

Though she kept a tight rein on government expenditure, Elizabeth left large debts to her successor. Wars during Elizabeth's reign are estimated to have cost over £5 million (at the prices of the time) which Crown revenues could not match - in 1588, for example, Elizabeth's total annual revenue amounted to some £392,000.

Despite the combination of financial strains and prolonged war after 1588, Parliament was not summoned more often. There were only 16 sittings of the Commons during Elizabeth's reign, five of which were in the period 1588-1601. Although Elizabeth freely used her power to veto legislation, she avoided confrontation and did not attempt to define Parliament's constitutional position and rights.

Elizabeth chose never to marry. If she had chosen a foreign prince, he would have drawn England into foreign policies for his own advantages (as in her sister Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain); marrying a fellow countryman could have drawn the Queen into factional infighting. Elizabeth used her marriage prospects as a political tool in foreign and domestic policies.

However, the 'Virgin Queen' was presented as a selfless woman who sacrificed personal happiness for the good of the nation, to which she was, in essence, 'married'.
Late in her reign, she addressed Parliament in the so-called 'Golden Speech' of 1601 when she told MPs: 'There is no jewel, be it of never so high a price, which I set before this jewel; I mean your love.' She seems to have been very popular with the vast majority of her subjects.

Overall, Elizabeth's always shrewd and, when necessary, decisive leadership brought successes during a period of great danger both at home and abroad. She died at Richmond Palace on 24 March 1603, having become a legend in her lifetime. The date of her accession was a national holiday for two hundred years. James VI of Scotland was Elizabeth's successor and became James I of England.",0
355,"China sets up international anti-corruption network, signs treaties with 81 countries","China has set up a preliminary anti-corruption cooperation network to track down fugitives at large in all continents and key countries.

China has established 169 extradition treaties and mutual legal assistance treaties with 81 countries as of November, according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China's top disciplinary watchdog.

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and escalating tensions in international relations, China's international anti-corruption efforts have never stopped. From January to August 2020, a total of 799 fugitives were caught under the ""Sky Net 2020"" operation, China News reported.

In recent years, China has continuously strengthened international judicial cooperation in law enforcement. By making comprehensive use of legal means like extradition, repatriation, and overseas arrests and prosecution, a large number of fugitives have been apprehended and stolen funds retrieved in accordance with the law.

China has netted 7,831 fugitives from more than 120 countries and regions in the past six years, including 60 of the 100 most-wanted Red Notice Chinese fugitives, and recovered more than 19 billion yuan in stolen funds ($2.88 billion), the Xinhua News Agency reported.

The enactment of a series of laws and regulations has enabled China to establish a relatively comprehensive anti-corruption system consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which has provided a better legal basis and more reliable procedural safeguards for disciplinary, inspection and supervisory organs to strengthen international efforts to track down fugitives and recover stolen goods.

""China has fully protected the legitimate rights and interests of the recovered persons, reflecting China's firm attitude to carry out international cooperation against corruption in strict accordance with the UN Convention against Corruption and bilateral treaties,"" Song Wei, director of the Center of Anti-Corruption Studies of University of Science and Technology Beijing, noted.

In October 2019, the CCDI signed a memorandum of understanding on anti-corruption cooperation with the UN.

China has actively participated in anti-corruption cooperation under multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the G20, APEC and BRICS, setting up a preliminary cooperation network of anti-corruption law enforcement, covering all continents and key countries, according to the CCDI.

In the process of carrying out its international anti-corruption operations, China has always strictly abided by the domestic laws of the target countries, international laws and international judicial and law enforcement practices, fully respected the legal systems and judicial sovereignty of other countries, submitted requests and cooperated strictly in accordance with multilateral conventions or bilateral agreements, and safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of criminal suspects, which has won support and recognition from the international community, the CCDI noted.",0
232,Brazilian State-Owned Bank Funds Documentary via Its Own Ethereum-Based Token,"A Brazilian state -owned bank is reportedly funding a documentary film through its own ether -based stablecoin, Cointelegraph Brazil reports on June 3.

Brazil’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) will finance the production of a documentary in collaboration with local cinema producer Elo Company, whose movie “The Boy and the World” by Alê Abreu was nominated for an Oscar in 2016.

According to the report, the funding for the project will be carried out through the national bank’s own cryptocurrency, BNDES token, a Brazilian real (BRL)-backed stablecoin that has been under development since 2018. BNDES’ stablecoin has reportedly had the first proof-of-concept conducted with the administration of the southeastern state of Brazil, Espírito Santo.

BNDES tokens, based on major token standard ERC-20, will be backed directly by the federal bank, which intends to utilize the token in order to bring more transparency in the management of funds within the financial institution, the report notes.

Brazilian regulators, including the country’s central bank, are reportedly aware of the BNDES stablecoin project and have been discussing the associated legal matters.

Earlier in January, new Brazilian president Jair Bolsonar criticized another local crypto-related initiative offering to build a cryptocurrency for indigenous people. At the time, the BNDES token was still expected to launch in 2019, as the president did not comment specifically on the project.

Recently, BNDES has reportedly selected five blockchain-focused startups in order to conduct its six-month acceleration program, BNDES Garage.

On May 31, the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil ordered a commission to be set up in order to discuss crypto-related regulation in the country.",0

344,India top general on China: ‘Larger conflict can’t be discounted’,"India’s top military commander has said a tense border standoff with Chinese forces in the western Himalayas could spark a larger conflict, even as senior commanders from both sides met near the front line for their eighth round of talks in recent months.

Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat said the situation was tense at the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border in eastern Ladakh where thousands of Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a months-long confrontation.

“We will not accept any shifting of the Line of Actual Control,” Rawat said in an online address.

“In the overall security calculus, border confrontations, transgressions and unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict cannot, therefore, be discounted,” he said.

Brutal hand-to-hand combat in June left 20 Indian and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers dead, escalating tensions and triggering large deployments on the remote, desolate border area.

Both sides have since attempted to ease the situation through diplomatic and military channels, but have made little headway, leaving soldiers facing-off in sub-zero temperatures in Ladakh’s snow deserts.

Meanwhile, senior Indian and Chinese commanders met in Ladakh on Friday for the eighth round of talks between the military leaderships since the crisis began, officials in New Delhi said.

The talks would likely include discussions on a Chinese proposal to pull some troops back from a contested area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso lake, where soldiers were separated by a few hundred metres, according to an Indian official.

Infantry troops, backed by artillery and armoured vehicles, are also facing off on the southern bank of the lake, where China has been pushing India to pull back, the official said.",0
314,A domestic terror law could quash political dissent in the US,"When President Trump announced his intention to designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation, his disregard for the upsurge of white right-wing extremist violence was obvious. So, too, was his objective -quashing political opposition to his administration.

Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a far-left ideological movement opposed to fascists, neo-Nazis and far-right groups. A loose collective of individuals and local groups, it lacks a chain of command or designated leaders.

Followers of this decentralised movement engage mostly in nonviolent activities such as protesting, giving speeches, tracking fascist groups and hanging up posters. However, Antifa followers, often clad in all black and wearing masks, justify militant anti-fascism action as self-defence of marginalised people against white supremacists. As a result, some have damaged property and physically attacked ideological opponents during protests. None have killed.

In stark contrast, right-wing hate groups have inspired some of their followers to kill 106 people between 2001 and 2016, according to the US Government Accountability Office. In Trump’s first year as president, right-wing groups were responsible for 31 violent attacks.

And yet, not once has Trump called for one of the nearly 1,000 right-wing extremist groups to be designated as a domestic terrorist organisation.

His double standards were on full display in 2017, when he claimed Antifa shared some of the blame for the murder of Heather Heyer during the Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville, Virginia. Heyer was killed when a self-professed neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of anti-fascists protesting against the far-right racist groups attending the rally. Refusing to acknowledge that the protest was organised by white supremacists, Trump stunningly stated that there were “very fine people on both sides”. Those so-called fine people included hundreds of Klansmen, Alt-Knights, and the Proud Boys – all of whom are eager to start a race war.

Meanwhile, Trump categorically smears Muslims as “terrorists”. Since 2015, he accused Islam of being a violent ideology, suggested creating a “ database of all Muslims in the US ” and issued a Muslim Ban. He continues Bush and Obama’s legacy of focusing on Muslims in domestic counterterrorism enforcement.

Indeed, Muslims have been the boogeymen propped up by both the Democrats and the Republicans to funnel billions of dollars to the FBI, DHS and DOJ National Security Division. The money, in turn, funds tens of thousands of counterterrorism agents, intelligence officers and prosecutors conducting surveillance, investigations and sting operations in Muslim communities under a preventive model of counterterrorism policing.

These activities had a chilling effect on Muslims’ free speech and freedom of religion, and caused many of them to self-censor and refrain from political activism – precisely what the government wants. Trump now wants to expand this rights-infringing schema to his left-wing opposition.

Notably, the grave damage to Muslims’ civil rights and liberties occurs through enforcement of international terrorism laws because only foreign organisations can be designated as “terrorist”. No law exists authorising the designation of a domestic group as a terrorist organisation. However, domestic terrorism is defined in 18 USC 2331(5) as “acts dangerous to human life that occur primarily in the United States, violate federal or state criminal laws, and are intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence government policy by intimidation or coercion”.

Should Congress pass a law authorising domestic groups to be designated as terrorist according to this definition, it would be the death knell of political groups disfavoured by whoever is president at a particular time.

Individuals associated with the designated group, even if not engaged in violent acts, could be prosecuted for material support to terrorism and imprisoned for up to 15 years. Donating funds, providing training, joining protests and other non-violent actions associated with designated domestic groups would be illegal.

The counterterrorism preventive model would also invite pre-emptive surveillance and investigations based on people’s ideologies, associations and political memberships.

A domestic terrorism law, thus, would regress the nation back to a dark era when the law was weaponised to quash domestic political dissent. During the 1950s and 1960s, the infamous COINTELPRO under J Edgar Hoover deployed tens of thousands of informants and undercover agents to infiltrate and disrupt the Black Panther Party, Nation of Islam, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, anti-Vietnam war protesters and other civil rights groups.

Moreover, calls for a new statute that would allow for domestic groups to be designated as “terrorist” based on “ national security “ are belied by the fact that prosecutors can already choose from more than 51 criminal statutes, including murder, possessing or using weapons of mass destruction, bombing and assassination to prosecute politically motivated violence.

But being labelled a terrorist carries a heightened stigma, which in turn gives licence to the FBI to be more aggressive in their surveillance and investigative tactics.

Designating Antifa as a terrorist organisation would not only change the public view of Antifa as a radical political group that, while fringe and occasionally violent, falls under Americans’ expansive notions of free speech. It would unleash the full force of the government’s counterterrorism regime against political dissidents on the left. Nonviolent acts such as tracking fascist groups, counter-protesting against white supremacists, publicly defacing flyers of neo-Nazi speakers, and opposing law enforcement, would be treated as unlawful material support for terrorism.

Absent the terrorist label, the government must be much more careful to focus on violent acts, not radical speech or ideology, in how it investigates Antifa and other groups on the extremes of the political spectrum. Officials who abuse their power will find themselves subjects of Inspector General Reports exposing illegal surveillance of activists engaging in First Amendment protected activities, which occurred under the Bush administration.

To be sure, Trump’s primary targets of a domestic terrorism law will be left wing and minority activists.",0

Giuseppe Conte (Italian pronunciation: [dʒuˈzɛppe ˈkonte] university professor, jurist and politician, who has served as Prime Minister of Italy since June 2018. [4]

Conte spent the majority of his career as a law professor and was also a member of the Italian Bureau of Administrative Justice from 2013 to 2018. Following the 2018 general election, he was proposed as the independent leader of a coalition government between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League, despite not having previously fulfilled any political role. [5] After both parties agreed on a government program, he was sworn in as Prime Minister on 1 June by President Sergio Mattarella, appointing the M5S and League leaders as his deputies. [6] [7]

On 20 August 2019, Conte offered to resign as Prime Minister when the League filed a motion of no confidence in the coalition government. [8] [9] Subsequently, the M5S and the centre-left Democratic Party agreed to form a new government, with Conte remaining as its head. [10] In the process, Conte became the first Italian prime minister to lead separate governments with both right-wing and left-wing coalition partners. [11] [12]

Despite having started his political career as a technocratic prime minister, appointed to implement the government's program of M5S and League, during the final months of his first cabinet and especially during his second one, Conte became an increasingly influential and popular figure in Italian politics. [13] During his rule, he promoted important reforms like the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income, a constitutional reform to reduce the number of parliamentarians, the nationalizations of the Italian highway company ASPI and of the flag carrier Alitalia, [14] [15] as well as a stricter policy towards illegal immigration. [16] In 2020, Conte had to face one of the most dramatic events in Italian modern history, the COVID-19 pandemic. His government was the first in the Western world to implement a national lockdown to stop the spread of the disease. [17] [18] Despite being widely approved by public opinion, the lockdown was described also as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the Italian Republic. [19] Moreover, Conte's extensive use of decrees to impose restrictions in order to contain the pandemic arose criticism from journalists, political analysts and opposition politicians. [20] [21] The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was especially severe in Italy. [22] In July 2020, to answer the coronavirus recession, Conte and the other European leaders approved the Next Generation EU package, by which Italy would receive 209 billion Euros in grants and loans from the European Recovery Fund. [23]

Conte has been the first Italian prime minister without prior political office since Silvio Berlusconi in 1994, as well as the first from Southern Italy since Ciriaco De Mita in 1989. [24] [25] Conte also became the second longest-serving independent prime minister in the history of Italy. Moreover, his first cabinet was described by many publications, such as The New York Times and la Repubblica, as the ""first modern populist government in Western Europe"". [26] [27] [28] Conte has often been nicknamed ""the lawyer of the people"" (l'avvocato del popolo), as he also defined himself during his first speech as Prime Minister. [29] [30]

Early life and career[ edit ]

Conte was born on 8 August 1964 into a middle class family at Volturara Appula, near Foggia. [31] [32] His father Nicola was a public employee in the local municipality, while his mother Lillina Roberti was an elementary school teacher. [33] [34]

After his family moved to San Giovanni Rotondo, Conte attended the Classical Lyceum"" Pietro Giannone"" near San Marco in Lamis and then studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he graduated in 1988 with honors. [35] [36] [37] For a short terms, Conte studied abroad. In 1992, he moved to the United States to study at Yale Law School and Duquesne University and at the International Culture Institute in Vienna in 1993. He later researched or lectured at Sorbonne University in 2000, Girton College, Cambridge in 2001 and New York University in 2008. [38] [39]

He started his academic career during the 1990s, when he taught at Roma Tre University, at LUMSA University in Rome, at the University of Malta and at the University of Sassari. [36] Conte is currently professor of private law at the University of Florence and at LUISS of Rome. [40] [41] He sits on the board of trustees of John Cabot University in Rome. [42] Conte's claim of having perfected studies at New York University have been challenged with the institution stating that ""A person by this name does not show up in any of our records as either a student or faculty member."" [43]

In 2010 and 2011, Conte served on the board of directors of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and in 2012 he was appointed by the Bank of Italy as a member of the ""Banking and Financial Arbitrage"" commission. [44] He served also in scientific committee of the Italian Foundation of Notaries. [45]

On 18 September 2013, he was elected by the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Bureau of Administrative Justice, the self-governing body of administrative magistrates, of which he served also as vice president. [46]

2018 government formation[ edit ]

On 9 May after weeks of political deadlock and the failure of various attempts of forming cabinets both between M5S– Centre-right and M5S– Democratic Party, Di Maio and Salvini responded to President Sergio Mattarella 's ultimatum to appoint a neutral technocratic caretaker government by officially requesting that he allow them 24 more hours to achieve a governing agreement between their two parties. [50] [51] Later that same day in the evening, Silvio Berlusconi publicly announced Forza Italia would not support a M5S–League government on a vote of confidence, but he would still maintain the centre-right alliance nonetheless, thus opening the doors to a possible majority government between the two parties. [52]

On 13 May, M5S and League reached an agreement in principle on a government program, likely clearing the way for the formation of a governing coalition between the two parties, but could not find an agreement regarding the members of a government cabinet, most importantly the Prime Minister. M5S and League leaders met with President Sergio Mattarella on 14 May to guide the formation of a new government. [53] On their meeting with President Mattarella, both parties asked for an additional week of negotiations to agree on a detailed government program and a Prime Minister to lead the joint government. Both M5S and the League announced their intention to ask their respective members to vote on the government agreement by the weekend. [54] [55]

On 21 May, Conte was proposed by Di Maio and Salvini for the role of Prime Minister in the 2018 Italian government, [56] [57] [58] despite reports in the Italian press suggesting that President Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government. [59] On 23 May, Conte was invited to the Quirinal Palace to receive the presidential mandate to form a new cabinet. [60] [61] In the traditional statement after the appointment, Conte said that he would be the ""defense lawyer of Italian people"". [62]

On 27 May, Conte renounced his office due to contrasts between Salvini and President Mattarella. Salvini proposed the university professor Paolo Savona as Minister of Economy and Finances, but Mattarella strongly opposed him, considering Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German. [63] In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the Eurozone and as the guarantor of the Italian Constitution and the country's interest and stability he could not allow this. [64] [65]

On the following day, Mattarella gave Carlo Cottarelli, a former director of the International Monetary Fund, the task of forming a new government. [66] On 28 May, the Democratic Party (PD) announced that it would abstain from voting the confidence to Cottarelli while the M5S and the center-right parties Forza Italia (FI), Brothers of Italy (FdI) and the League announced their vote against. [67] [68]

Cottarelli was expected to submit his list of ministers for approval to President Mattarella on 29 May. On that and the following day, he held only informal consultations with the President, waiting for the formation of a ""political government"". [69] [70] Meanwhile, Salvini and Di Maio announced their willingness to restart the negotiations to form a political government and Giorgia Meloni, leader of FdI, gave her support to the initiative. [69] [70] [71] On 31 May, M5S and the League declared of having reached an agreement about forming a new government without Paolo Savona as Finance Minister (he would become Minister of European Affairs instead) and with Conte at its head. [72] [73]

First Conte Cabinet[ edit ]

See also: Conte I Cabinet

On 1 June 2018, Conte officially succeeded the Democrat Paolo Gentiloni at the head of the Italian government and was sworn in as the new prime minister in the afternoon. [74] His cabinet was predominantly composed of members of the M5S and the League but also of prominent independent technocrats like the Minister of Foreign Affairs Enzo Moavero Milanesi, who previously served as the minister of European affairs in the government of Mario Monti, the university professor Giovanni Tria as the minister of economy and finances and economist Paolo Savona, who served in the cabinet of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in the 1990s and is currently known for his Eurosceptic views, who became the new minister of European affairs. [75] [76]

Both parties' leaders Salvini and Di Maio were appointed Deputy Prime Ministers. While the first became Minister of the Interior, with the main aim of drastically reducing the number of illegal immigrants, the latter served as Minister of Economic Development, Labour and Social Policies to introduce the universal basic income. [77] [78]

The coalition of the two populist parties which Conte led was also known as Government of Change, [79] thanks to a document that summarized the electoral programmes of the two parties, which was called ""Contract for the Government of Change"". [80] [81]

Conte speaks to the European Parliament in February 2019

During his speech before the investiture vote in the Italian Senate on 5 June, Conte announced his willingness to reduce illegal immigration and increase the pressure on human traffickers and smugglers. He also advocated a fight against political corruption, the introduction of a law which regulates the conflict of interests, a new bill which expands the right of self-defense, a reduction in taxes and a drastic cut to money going to elected politicians and government bureaucrats. [82] [83] [84] [85] Conte also proposed to lift the international sanctions against Russia. [86]

The Senate approved the confidence vote with 171 votes in favor and 117 against, with 25 abstentions. [87] The cabinet was supported by M5S, Lega, two senators from Associative Movement Italians Abroad (MAIE) and two independents while the Democratic Party (PD), Forza Italia (FI), Free and Equal (LeU) and other small leftist parties voted against it. The far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI) and other ten independent senators abstained. [88] On the following day, he received 350 votes in favor out of 630 in the Chamber of Deputies, 236 votes against and 35 abstained. [89] As in the Senate, PD, FI and LeU voted against the government while FdI abstained. Besides M5S and League, Conte received two votes from independent deputies and one vote from Vittorio Sgarbi, a notable and controversial member of Forza Italia who has always heavily criticised the M5S, but decided to support the cabinet in respect of Salvini and with the hope that a M5S government could lead toward their failure. [90] [91]

On 5 February 2019, Conte became acting Minister of European Affairs after the resignation of Paolo Savona, who was elected President of the Companies and Exchange Commission (CONSOB). [92] [93] He held the ad interim office until 10 July 2019, when he appointed Lorenzo Fontana as new minister. [94]

Main articles: 2019 Italian government crisis and Conte II Cabinet

In August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Salvini announced a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority. [95] Many political analysts believe the no confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in Parliament, ensuring Salvini could become the next Prime Minister. [96] On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate at the Senate, in which Conte accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who ""had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest"" and stated ""this government ends here"", [97] [9] the Prime Minister resigned his post to President Mattarella. [98]

However, during the round of the so-called consultations between Mattarella and the parliamentary groups, a possible new majority emerged, between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party. [99] On 28 August, PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti announced at the Quirinal Palace his favorable position on keeping Giuseppe Conte at the head of the new government, [100] and on same day, Mattarella summoned Conte to the Quirinal Palace for 29 August to give him the task of forming a new cabinet. [101] On 4 September, Conte announced the ministers of his new cabinet, which was sworn in at the Quirinal Palace on the following day. [102] On 9 September 2019 the Chamber of Deputies granted the confidence to the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against and 3 abstentions. [103] [104] On 10 September 2019, in the second vote of confidence in the Senate, 169 lawmakers voted in favour of his government and 133 against. [105]

On 16 September, after few days from the investiture vote, in an interview to la Repubblica, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to leave the PD, launching a new centrist and liberal party named Italia Viva (IV). [106] [107] In the interview he confirmed also the support to Conte's government. [108] Two ministers and one undersecretary followed Renzi in his new movement. [109]

In December 2019 the Minister of Education, University and Research Lorenzo Fioramonti resigned after disagreements with the rest of the cabinet regarding the recently approved 2020 budget bill. Fioramonti considered the share of funds dedicated to education and research to be insufficient. [110] Conte took the ministerial role ad interim, and announced his decision to split the Ministry of Education, University and Research into two: a Ministry of Public Education led by former undersecretary Lucia Azzolina (M5S), and a Ministry of University and Research led by the dean of the University of Naples Federico II Gaetano Manfredi (Independent), who were sworn in on 10 January. [111] [112]

One of Conte's main proposals was the scheduled reform of the Italian tax system, mainly promoted by the League and characterized by the introduction of flat taxes for businesses and individuals, with a no-tax area for low-income households and some small corrections to keep some degree of tax progression as required by the Italian Constitution. [113] [114] The government stressed that they will find the funds to implement it through the so-called ""fiscal peace"", that is a condonation. [115] However, many important economists [ who? ] and newspapers like Il Sole 24 Ore denounced that the condonation could not finance all the new tax system based on flat tax. [116]

In 2018, Conte's first government, introduced a flat tax with a 15% rate, applied to small entrepreneurs and self-employed with an amount of annual revenues inferior to €65,000. Despite the so-called ""flat regime"" was a proposal of the right-wing League, it was confirmed also by Conte's second government, with the centre-left. [117]

During his first cabinet, his government rolled out the so-called "" citizens' income"" (Italian: reddito di cittadinanza), a system of social welfare provision that provides a basic income and assistance in finding a job in order to help poor people and families. [118] [119] The income was set to a maximum of €780 per month, and in its first year the program has almost 2.7 million applications. [120] [121] The bill was later confirmed by Conte's second cabinet. [122]

During Conte's governments, more severe punishments for tax dodgers, which are a major problem in Italy, had been approved. [123] With the 2020 financial bill, the government introduced a bill which provided prison for ""great tax dodgers"". [124]

In September 2019, at the head of his second government, Conte launched the so-called ""Green New Deal"", named after the analogous US proposed legislation that aimed to address climate change and economic inequality. [125] In the same period, he praised students who protested against climate change, stating: ""The images of the squares of the Fridays for Future are extraordinary, with so many young people participating with such passion. From the government there is the utmost commitment to translate this request for change into concrete solutions. We all have a great responsibility."" [126]

In January 2020, the cabinet increased to €100 per month the so-called ""Renzi bonus"", a monthly allowance introduced by Matteo Renzi 's government in 2014, recognized to holders of a total annual income not exceeding €24,600. [127] A total of 11.7 million people benefited of the bonus in 2020. [128]

In February 2020, Conte appointed Mariana Mazzucato as his economic counselor. [129] Mazzucato, a professor at the University College London, is considered one of the most prominent supporter of state intervensionism. [130]

In April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic which severely affected Europe, Conte became the most vocal supporter of the eurobonds ' issuance to face the crisis, [131] describing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as ""completely inadequate"". [132] Conte found key allies in France, Spain, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Luxembourg, which demanded more to be done in relation to coronavirus pandemic; [133] while Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Estonia strongly opposed the eurobonds. [134] Conte, during an interview to German weekly Die Zeit, questioned: ""What do we want to do in Europe? Does each member state want to go its own way?"", [135] he also added: ""If we are a union, now is the time to prove it."" [136] On 8 April, he stated ""we should loosened European fiscal rules, otherwise we would have to cancel Europe and everyone will do on their own."" [137] On 23 April, the European Council agreed on a ESM without conditionality to sustain direct and indirect healthcare costs and the implementation of the so-called recovery fund to help the reconstruction. [138]

Prime Minister Conte at the European Council, in July 2020

On 13 May, the Council of Ministers approved the so-called ""Relaunch decree"", with a budget of nearly €55 billion. [139] The decree included an ""emergency income"" of €400 to €800 for lower-income families, a bonus of €600 to €1,000 to self-employed workers, a reduction of €4 billion in taxes for all businesses with total annual revenues below €250 million, more than €3 billion in investments in the healthcare system, and a ""holiday bonus"" of €500 for lower-income families. [140] The decree also provided economic aids to the tourism sector and regularization of nearly 600,000 undocumented immigrants, mainly employed in agricultural works. [141]

From 13 to 21 June, Prime Minister Conte organized a conference called Progettiamo il Rilancio (English: We Design the Relaunch), [142] [143] better known as ""estates general"", [144] in Villa Doria Pamphili in Rome, with the aim of ""forging a coherent and well-funded plan for Italy's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis"". [145] The government invited prominent international politicians like Paolo Gentiloni, David Sassoli and Ursula von der Leyen, economists like Christine Lagarde, Ignazio Visco, Kristalina Georgieva, Olivier Jean Blanchard, Esther Duflo and Tito Boeri, and managers like Vittorio Colao. [146] The three main trade unions of the country, CGIL, CISL and UIL, and the Italian industrial employers' confederation, Confindustria, took part to the estates general too. [147] The Prime Minister invited also the opposition leaders, however, on 10 June, Matteo Salvini, Giorgia Meloni and Antonio Tajani stated that they would not participate to the conference. [148]

From 17 to 21 July, Giuseppe Conte took part in one of the longest European Councils in history. After days of harsh confrontations, especially between Conte and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, [149] the European leaders agreed on a new proposal by the President of the Council, Charles Michel, which provided a budget of €750 billion for the so-called Recovery Fund, composed of €390 billion in grants and €360 billion in loans. [150] Italy would benefit from nearly €82 billion in grants and €127 billion in loans. [151] Prime Minister Conte described the deal as an ""historic day for Italy and Europe"". [152]

When Conte became Prime Minister in 2018, he acted quickly to deliver on promises to the government's anti-immigration base through strict controls on immigration to Italy. Since 2013, Italy had absorbed over 700,000 African migrants arriving by boat from Libya. [153] [154] During his premiership, Conte and his Interior Minister Matteo Salvini promoted stricter policies regarding immigration and public security. [155]

After Conte's approval on 10 June 2018, Salvini announced the closure of Italian ports, stating: ""Everyone in Europe is doing their own business, now Italy is also raising its head. Let's stop the business of illegal immigration"". [156] The vessel Aquarius, which is operated jointly by Médecins Sans Frontières and SOS Méditerranée and carried more than 600 migrants, was refused a port of disembarkation by the Italian authorities despite having been told to rescue the migrants by the same co-ordination centre. The Italian authority told the vessel to ask Malta to provide a disembarkation port, but Malta also refused. [157] On the following day, the new Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez accepted the disputed migrant ship. [158] Conte accused French President Emmanuel Macron of hypocrisy after Macron said Italy was acting ""irresponsibly"" by refusing entry to migrants and suggested it had violated international maritime law. [159]

On 24 September 2018, the Council of Ministers approved the so-called ""Salvini decree"", which contained a series of hardline measures that will see the Italian government abolish key forms of protection for migrants and make it easier for them to be deported. The decree will also suspend the refugee application process of those who are considered ""socially dangerous"" or who have been convicted of a crime. [160]

On 23 September 2019, Italy and other four European countries, Germany, France, Malta and Finland, agreed on a draft deal to present to other EU countries on how to manage the migrant crisis and distribute those saved from the Mediterranean. [161] This agreement was considered a win for Conte and his new interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese. [162] [163] [164]

On 8 April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the government closed all Italian ports until 31 July, stating that they do not ensure the necessary requirements for the classification and definition of ""safe place"", established by the Hamburg Rules on maritime search and rescue."" [165]

Ponte Morandi collapse[ edit ]

Main article: Ponte Morandi § Collapse

Conte at the inauguration of the new bridge, in August 2020

On 14 August 2018, during a torrential rainstorm over the city of Genoa, a 210-metre (690 ft) section of Ponte Morandi collapsed. [166] [166] Between 30 and 35 cars and three trucks were reported to have fallen from the bridge, killing 43 people. [167] [168]

The day after the collapse, Conte declared a state of emergency for the Liguria region, which would last for a year. [169] After few days, Conte appointed Marco Bucci, mayor of Genoa, as extraordinary commissioner for the reconstruction. [170] Moreover, the government put pressure on the managers of the Italian highway company, Autostrade per l’Italia (ASPI), which is part of the Benetton family 's owned Atlantia. [171] The M5S asked the revocation of license to Benetton family and the nationalization of ASPI. [172] However, despite bitter controversies, the revocation was not immediately implemented.

The last two cable-stayed pillars of the bridge were demolished using a tonne of explosives on 28 June 2019. The complete bridge was planned to be removed, along with multiple damaged houses in the surrounding area. [173] The reconstruction of a replacement bridge, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, started on 25 June 2019 and was completed on 28 April 2020. [174]

On 3 August 2020, the new bridge, named "" Saint George Bridge"", from the patron saint of the Republic of Genoa, was inaugurated by Conte and President Mattarella and opened to motor vehicles after a few days. [175] [176]

Nationalization of the highway company[ edit ]

In July 2020, the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Paola De Micheli, announced that the license would be temporarily assigned to ASPI. [177] This statement caused harsh criticism both from the right-wing opposition and the M5S. [178] On 13 July, Conte definitely stopped any possible prorogation of the license to ASPI, stating that the company's proposal ""was totally unacceptable"". [179] He also added: ""The members of Benetton family has not yet understood that this government will not accept to sacrifice the public good on the altar of their interests."" [180]

On 15 July, the government and Atlantia reached an agreement which brought to the nationalization of the national highway company ASPI, [181] with the state that would held a majority partecipation through Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, while Atlantia would kept only 10% of the company's stocks. [182] Then, in a second phase, a listing is planned, with the aim of creating a company with a widespread shareholder base. [183]

Constitutional reform[ edit ]

Main article: 2020 Italian constitutional referendum

Under Conte's governments, the Italian Parliament approved the so-called "" Fraccaro Reform"", from the name of the M5S deputy who was the bill's first signatory. [184] The reform was finally approved by the Parliament, with the fourth and final vote in the Chamber of Deputies on 8 October with 553 votes in favor and 14 against. In the final vote, the bill was supported both by the majority and the opposition; [185] only the liberal party More Europe (+Eu) and other small groups voted against. [186] The reform provided a cut in the number of MPs, which would shrink from 630 to 400 deputies and from 315 to 200 senators. [187]

After the approval, Conte stated: ""The cut to the parliamentarians is a reform that will bring to a greater efficiency of the parliamentary jobs. Now, citizens to be closer to the institutions. It is a historical passage that, together with other projected reform, will be a prelude to greater efficiency of our parliamentary system."" [188]

The referendum to approve the reform was scheduled on 29 March, however it was postponed to 20–21 September due to the coronavirus pandemic which severely affected Italy. [189] In September, Italians largely approved the reform with nearly 70% of votes. [190]

Coronavirus pandemic[ edit ]

In February 2020, Italy became one of the world's main centres for confirmed cases of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that originated in China. [191] As of November 2020, more than 900,000 coronavirus cases and 41,000 deaths were confirmed, affecting mainly Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont. [192]

In late January, the government banned all flights from and to China, becoming the first European country to adopt this measure. [193] On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a bill to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy. Prime Minister Conte stated: ""In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sport events has already been ordered in those areas."" [194]

Schools were closed in 10 municipalities in Lombardy, one in Veneto and in Emilia-Romagna. In some areas, all public events were cancelled and commercial activities were halted. [195] Regional train services suspended the stops in the most affected areas – with trains not stopping at Codogno, Maleo and Casalpusterlengo stations. [196] [197] Universities in Lombardy suspended all activities from 23 February. [198] [199] After few days, schools and universities closed in the whole country. [200]

On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Conte extended the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, putting more than a quarter of the national population under lockdown. [201] On the following day, he announced in a press conference that all measures previously applied only in the so-called ""red zones"" had been extended to the whole country, putting de facto 60 million people in lockdown. He later proceeded to officially sign the executive decree. [202] [203] This measure was described as the largest lockdown in human history. [204] [205] [206] [207]

The lockdown measures, despite being widely approved by public opinion, [208] were also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the republic. [209] [210] Nevertheless, Article 16 of the Constitution states that travel restrictions may be established by law for reasons of health or security. [211]

On 20 March, the Ministry of Health ordered tighter regulations on free movement. The new measures banned open-air sports and running, except individually and in close proximity of one's residence. Parks, playgrounds and public green were closed down. Furthermore, movement across the country was further restricted, by banning ""any movement towards a residence different from the main one"", including holiday homes, during weekends and holidays. [212] While on the following day, Conte announced further restrictions within the nationwide lockdown, by halting all non-essential production, industries and businesses in Italy, [213] following the rise in the number of new cases and deaths in the previous days. [214] [215]

On 24 March, in a live-streamed press conference, Conte announced a new decree approved by the Council of Ministers. The decree imposed higher fines for the violation of the restrictive measures, and a regulation of the relationship between government and Parliament during the emergency. It included also the possibility of reducing or suspending public and private transport, and gave the regional governments power to impose additional restrictive regulations in their Regions for a maximum of seven days before being confirmed by national decree. [216] [217]

On 1 April, Conte's government extended the period of lockdown until 13 April. [218] While on 6 April, Conte announced a new economic stimulus plan, consisting of €200 billion of state-guaranteed loans to companies and additional €200 billion of guarantees to support exports. [219]

On 10 April, Conte made further announcements extending the lockdown until the 3rd of May, allowing some specific businesses, like bookstores and silviculture activities, to reopen under specific safe measures. [220] On the same day, he appointed a task force to relaunch Italy after the crisis; the team was led by Vittorio Colao and composed by a total of nineteen members, chosen among university professors, managers and public administration officers, which notably included Mariana Mazzucato and Enrico Giovannini. [221]

On 26 April, the Prime Minister announced the so-called ""Phase 2"", that would start from May 4. Movements across regions were still forbidden, while the ones between municipalities and provinces were allowed only for work and health reasons as well as for visit relatives. [222] Moreover, he allowed the re-opening of closed factories, but schools, bars, restaurants and barbers were still closed. [223]

On 18 May, the lockdown officially ended and the government allowed the re-openings of bars, restaurants, barbers and gyms. However, travels across regions were still limited. [224] After a few days, the government proposed the recruitment of 60,000 volunteers, known as ""civic assistants"", to help oversee social distancing. [225] The measure, announced by Francesco Boccia, the regional affairs minister, was heavily criticised by both the opposition and Renzi's Italia Viva; [226] Brothers of Italy 's leader, Giorgia Meloni, accused the government of pursuing an authoritarian drift. [227]

On 1 June, the Ministry of Health launched the Immuni app for smartphone, [228] a contact-tracing app, designed to help authorities manage the so-called ""Phase 2"" of the coronavirus crisis. [229] The app aimed to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible, even when they were asymptomatic. These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others. [230] The opposition harshly criticized the app, accusing the government of establishing an Orwell -like Big Brother; [231] in the first weeks the app was downloaded by more than four million people. [232] [233] [234]

On 28 and 29 July, the Parliament approved the extension of the state of emergency until October 2020, proposed by the government. [235] The state of emergency, which was firstly introduced in January 2020, gave greater powers to the prime minister and the government in facing the crisis. [236] The extension created criticism both from the opposition and the liberal wing of the government. [237] The right-wing leader Giorgia Meloni accused the government of pursuing a ""dangerous liberticidal drift"", asserting that the emergency was already over. [238] Conte described Meloni's accusations as ""dangerous and false"", [239] adding that the extension of the emergency was a ""legitimate and inevitable measure"", which became necessary because ""the virus continues to circulate in the country"". [240] On 16 August, after an increase in the daily number of new COVID-19 cases, the government closed all the discos and night clubs, and imposed to wear a mask outdoors in some areas considered at risk of crowding. [241]

In October 2020, the confirmed cases continued to grow, reaching the daily record since the beginning of the pandemic. [242] On 7 October, the Parliament postponed the end of the state of emergency to 31 January 2021. [243] On 13 October, the Council of Ministers approved a new decree concerning further restrictions for bars and restaurants as well as the mandatory use of protection mask outdoors. [244] On 18 October, Conte announced further restrictions, including limitations to the opening hours of bars and restaurants, as well as a suspension of amateur contact sports, local festivals and conferences. [245] On 25 October, the government introduced new restrictions, imposing the closing of gyms, swimming pools, theatres and cinemas, as well as the closing of bars and restaurants by 6pm. [246]

On 4 November 2020, Prime Minister Conte announced a lockdown for a significant portion of the country. Lombardy, Piedmont, Aosta Valley and Calabria, known as ""Red Zones"", were put under a strict lockdown, similar to the one which was implement from March to May 2020. [247] A lesser strict lockdown was implement in the ""Orange Zones"" of Apulia and Sicily, while the rest of the country was declared ""Yellow Zone"", with a few restrictions. Conte described the situation as ""particularly critical"", asserting that the virus was moving at a ""strong and even violent"" pace. [248]

Since the beginning of his term as prime minister, Conte's foreign policy has been characterized by a lenient approach to Russia. For example, he pressed for the repeal of international sanctions against Russia, which according to him ""damage the Italian economy"". [249] He also considered Russia a strategic partner in the fight against Islamic terrorism. [250] However, Conte stressed that under his leadership Italy will remain an active member of NATO and a close ally of the United States. [251] In March 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, after a phone call with Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin arranged the Russian army to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy, which was the European country hardest hit by coronavirus. [252]

During his premiership, Conte built a close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. Since the beginning of Conte's government, Trump considered him a key ally during international meetings [253] as well as his ""privileged interlocutor"" in Europe. [254] On 8 and 9 June, Conte participated in his first G7 summit, hosted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Canada. [255] During the summit, he was the only leader to back President Trump and his proposal to readmit Russia into the G7. [256] However, he later assumed a more pro-European view, shared by the other five leaders, condemning Trump tariffs on steel and aluminium exported by the European Union. [257] On the following day, Conte was thanked for his positions on Russia and his populist stance by President Trump, who invited him to the White House. [258] On 28 June, Conte participated in his first European Council meeting and blocked a joint EU trade and defense statement criticizing Trump's tariff policy. [259]

In June 2018, Trump praised Conte, describing him as a ""really great leader"" and ""very strong on immigration"". [260] Trump also endorsed Conte during the 2019 government crisis, hoping that he could remain Prime Minister. [261] On 31 March 2020, President Trump announced that the United States would send 100 million dollars of medical aids to Italy. [262] After few days, during an interview at the NBC, Conte described Trump as ""Italy's most true and loyal friend"". [263] On 11 April, Trump issued an executive order in which he allowed U.S. militaries deployed in Italy to assist Italian law enforcement in facing the crisis. [264]

At the beginning of his political career, Conte was described as a populist and Eurosceptic politician, openly critical towards the EU, whose economic and financial rules were described as ""old and outdated"". [265] However, he later toned down his Eurosceptic rhetoric, thus still remaining a vocal anti-austerity leader, as it became evidence during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which severely affected Europe. [266]

In March 2019, Conte and the Chinese President Xi Jinping signed in Rome 29 economic and institutional agreements amounting to 2.5 billion euros, including a memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative investments program. [267] [268] Prime Minister Conte's position on the Chinese investments program was criticized by the other major Western powers. [269]

In August 2019, amid of a serious government crisis, Conte took part, as caretaker Prime Minister, in the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz, in what it was believed to be his last summit as head of government. [270] The main topics of the summit included global trade, climate change, taxing technology companies, [271] but also Iran nuclear deal, [272] and 2019 Amazon wildfires. [273]

Conte criticized the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria. He stated that the offensive ""puts the region's civilians and stability in jeopardy."" [274]

In January 2020, the situation of the Libyan Civil War became increasingly worrying, with the troops of field marshal Khalifa Haftar approaching Tripoli. During the crisis, Prime Minister Conte had a series of bilateral meetings in Rome both with Haftar and Fayez al-Sarraj, the Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya, who are considered two of the main contenders in the civil war. [275] After pressures from the international community, on 12 January Haftar announced a ceasefire. [276]

In November 2018, Silvia Romano, a 23-year-old Italian aid worker, was kidnapped in Kenya by a group of terrorists linked to Al-Shabaab. [277] On 9 May 2020, Conte announced her liberation in a tweet. [278] Immediately after the announcement, speculations rose about the ransom paid to the kidnappers, which according to some sources stood at around €4 million. [279] Moreover, Romano became the target of a hate campaign by the right-wing opposition due to her conversion to Islam, occurred during the captivity. [280] During a discussion in the Chamber of Deputies, Alessandro Pagano, a member of the League, called her a ""neo-terrorist"". [281]

Political views and public image[ edit ]

During his first cabinet, Conte has often been considered a neo-nationalist politician, [282] however, since September 2019, when he became the head of a centre-left coalition government, he slightly toned down his nationalist rhetoric, [283] while he continued to use various instances of the so-called banal nationalism. [284] [285] Despite being labeled as a post-ideological leader, [286] Conte described his political ideal as ""new humanism"". [287] [288]

During an interview in 2018, Conte said he used to vote for the Democratic Party before approaching the M5S during the late 2010s. [289] He also added that today ""the ideological schemes of the 20th century are no longer adequate to represent the current political system"" and it should be ""more important and correct to evaluate the work of a political force on how it is positioned on the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms"". [290]

In his inaugural speech at the Senate on 5 June 2018, [291] [292] in response to attacks on government political forces accused of being populist and anti-establishment, Conte replied that ""if populism is the attitude of the ruling class to listen to the people's needs [...] and if anti-establishment means aiming at introducing a new system able to remove old privileges and encrusted power, well, these political forces deserve both these epithets"". [293] [294] [295]

He also opposed the ""hypertrophy of Italian laws"", advocating the repeal of useless laws and supported a simplification of bureaucracy. [296] As a professor, Conte strongly opposed the school reform legislation promoted by Matteo Renzi 's government in 2015, known as ""The Good School"", which, according to him, must be completely revised. [297] Contrasts with Matteo Renzi became evident during Conte's second government. Despite the cabinet is supported, among others, by Renzi's Italia Viva, the former Prime Minister has often accused Conte of being a populist politician, threatening to withdraw his party's support. [298]

According to public opinion surveys, Conte's approval rating was always above 50% during all his first cabinet, then it dropped to 40% in the early months of his second government. [299] However, in March 2020, amid the coronavirus crisis, his approval rating rose above 70%, one of the highest ever ratings for an Italian Prime Minister. [300] [301] In July 2020, according to Ilvo Diamanti 's opinion polling firm, Demos&Pi, Conte was selected as the best Prime Minister of the last 25 years. [302] Moreover, with more than 3 million followers, Conte is one of the most followed European leaders on Facebook. [303]

Personal life[ edit ]

Giuseppe Conte married Valentina Fico, a lawyer from Rome and daughter of a former director of the Santa Cecilia conservatory. [304] They have a child, Niccolò, born in 2007. [305] However, they divorced after a few years. [306] Conte is currently engaged with Olivia Paladino (born 1979), [307] daughter of the Roman entrepreneur Cesare Paladino and the Swedish actress Ewa Aulin. [308]

Controversies[ edit ]

Giuseppe Conte in the Prime Minister's office, in 2020

On 21 May 2018, when Conte was proposed to President Mattarella as candidate for prime minister, [57] The New York Times questioned his summer stays at New York University (NYU) listed in his official curriculum vitae [38] in an article asserting that a NYU spokeswoman could not find Conte in university ""records as either a student or faculty member"". [59] [314] Similar doubts arose concerning his study period in France at the Sorbonne University. [315]

The following day, the Associated Press reported in an article published also by The New York Times that the NYU spokeswoman added that ""while Mr. Conte had no official status at NYU, he was granted permission to conduct research in the NYU law library"" during the period listed in his official curriculum vitae. [38] [316] Similarly, the Duquesne University of Pittsburgh and the University of Malta found no record of him in their archives, [317] although it was confirmed that Conte held lectures at the old university building in Valletta, Malta, for the Foundation for International Studies. [318] Yale University, contacted by another newspaper, confirmed that he was a visiting scholar there for three months. [319]

Moreover, Conte stated in his CV that he had worked for his legal studies at the Kulturinstitut in Vienna, Austria, but this is a language school, not a law school. [315]
