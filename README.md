# Negative News Neural Nets Project: Classifying Media Articles with Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

All financial organizations need to do compliance investigations on their customers to prevent potential criminal activity. Looking for negative news (i.e. adverse media) on would-be clients aids in those investigations. 

This being said, doing the compliance checks manually takes a lot of resources, both in terms of time and money. Using a statistical model that can differentiate between adverse and non-adverse media articles can speed up the screening process.

This project is an attempt in automating the screening process described above. Its main goal is to provide a model that determines whether a given article is adverse or not. Further improvements; such as confirming if the article is adverse against a given person/organization, or returning the type of adverse media topic, are possible.

## Project

This project is a part of data science competition, with processes similar to that of Kaggle. Original data consists of 977 adverse media and 642 non-adverse media articles, scraped through the web together with the participants of two other teams(10 people in total). It must be noted that this data is checked afterwards, again with all participants. The manual labelling and cross checks took a lot of time, but eventually provided fruitful results for data quality.

### Data

Training data can be found under the data folder with the names "adverse_media_training.csv.zip" and "non_adverse_media_training.csv.zip". The test datasets are self explanatory.
