# Negative News Neural Nets Project: Classifying Media Articles with Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

All financial organizations need to do compliance investigations on their customers to prevent potential criminal activity. Looking for negative news (i.e. adverse media) on would-be clients aids in those investigations. 

This being said, doing the compliance checks manually takes a lot of resources, both in terms of time and money. Using a statistical model that can differentiate between adverse and non-adverse media articles can speed up the screening process.

This project is an attempt in automating the screening process described above. Its main goal is to provide a model that determines whether a given article is adverse or not. Further improvements; such as confirming if the article is adverse against a given person/organization, or returning the type of adverse media topic, are possible.
